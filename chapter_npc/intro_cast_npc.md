Notable Collective Entities

The Five Mikas – Symbolic of loyalty, unity, and silent resilience. Later gain unique powers and become a living archetype in the story.

The Aeon Keepers – A metaphysical faction of old; voices tied to ancient magic systems and cosmic judgment.

The Nefereti – Ethereal spirits tied to the Akashic flow, existing between worlds, bound to balance.

Let me know if you’d like to:

Flesh out the Five Mikas into individual variants later.

Give names and traits to certain slaves for sidequests or NPC arcs.

Tie each slave group to a different elemental or cultural influence from their origins.


Otherwise, this wraps the intro arc into a complete mythic engine. Ready when you are to dive into Chapter 1.
