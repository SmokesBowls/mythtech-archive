        "Near the Verdant Grove, the rider saw Isla and Elyse cornered. Tran and Keen arrived just in time, but more reptilians emerged from the shadows. "
        "Acting without hesitation, the rider spurred forward—his horse crashing into one attacker.\n\n"
        "He helped Isla up. Her ankle was twisted, bleeding. As he touched her, the wound began to knit together. "
        "The rider blinked, uncertain if it was a trick of light. But Elyse’s expression told him otherwise.\n\n"
        "Panic gave way to urgency. Elyse pointed toward higher ground—the Council Tree. Runes mirrored the Needle’s markings. "
        "The sky thundered, but brought no rain—only the sound of giants beyond the hills."
