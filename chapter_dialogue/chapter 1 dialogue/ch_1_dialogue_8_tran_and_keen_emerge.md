        "The rider watched in awe as the meditating woman—Keen—snapped out of her trance. "
        "Beside her, the young man—Tran—moved with seamless timing. They sprinted toward the village center.\n\n"
        "Through fire and smoke, they danced between burning homes and stunned villagers. Rowan’s forge was a blur behind them. "
        "Reptilian warriors fell without warning. Their movements—fluid, coordinated, and devastating—spoke of something deeper. "
        "Something awakened. The rider’s blood stirred in recognition, pulsing in response to their unspoken bond.\n\n"
        "He tracked them instinctively, his vision still sharpened beyond normal sight. Everything felt mythic. Ancient patterns shimmered beneath the chaos."
