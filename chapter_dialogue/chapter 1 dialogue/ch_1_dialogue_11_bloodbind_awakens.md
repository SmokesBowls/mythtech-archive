        "The reptilian lunged—its target Isla. The rider didn’t think, he moved. His palm raised instinctively, blood surging. "
        "A crimson arc snapped from his hand like a living whip.\n\n"
        "It wrapped the reptilian’s throat and constricted. Time held still. Recognition flickered in the creature’s eyes. "
        "It knew this power. It feared it.\n\n"
        "The whip withdrew into his skin. The reptilian fell, unmoving. Above, the Star Needle flared violently—as if answering his awakening. "
        "The moment passed, but the silence it left was sacred. Garic whispered the words of old. Others watched in awe.\n\n"
        "The truth was unavoidable now: something ancient lived in the rider’s blood. And it was awake."
