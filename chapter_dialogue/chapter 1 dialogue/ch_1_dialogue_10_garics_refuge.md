        "The rider helped Isla and Elyse reach him. For a moment, Garic locked eyes with the stranger—seeing something older than blood. "
        "The reflection of the Star Needle pulsed in his weathered gaze. Then: a crash. Reptilian warriors broke through the underbrush. "
        "The rider’s palm flared with power, instincts overriding fear."
