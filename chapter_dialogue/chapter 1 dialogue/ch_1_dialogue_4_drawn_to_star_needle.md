        "The rider stepped out into the street, his gaze drawn to the towering Star Needle. The sunlight began to fall, "
        "casting long shadows through the geometric water channels. Something about their pattern tugged at him—a pulse, a whisper in the blood. "
        "He drifted forward, almost unaware, his horse trailing loosely behind.\n\n"
        "As he neared, the monolith's bioluminescent patterns pulsed in rhythm with his heartbeat. The spiral water channels converged around its base, "
        "forming a sacred pool. No one guarded it. No warnings, no sentinels. And yet the villagers gave it space, treating it with quiet reverence.\n\n"
        "Children played nearby, but none dared touch the pool. A young woman meditated in stillness beside it—Keen, though he did not yet know her name. "
        "A boy passed him by—Tran, the Crimson Blood bearer—still unaware of the fate awaiting him. \n\n"
        "The rider felt something stir as he approached. A thirst. A familiarity. He knelt beside the pool and touched the water.\n\n"
        "Pain flashed through his palm, followed by a drop of blood falling into the still surface. Crimson swirled outward in perfect geometry, "
        "echoed by a flash from the Needle. Something in him had changed, though no mark remained on his skin."
