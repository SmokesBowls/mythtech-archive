        "The first warning came not as darkness, but as wind—hot and sharp, like breath from a forge. "
        "It stripped the wheat stem from his lips and carried it into a sky that suddenly felt too wide, too empty. "
        "Then the mountains moved. At first, a heat-shimmer illusion. But they shook—stone groaning against stone.\n\n"
        "The earth trembled beneath his horse, thunder rising from deep within. Then came the shadow—"
        "not cast by cloud, but by something far more ancient, vast, and deliberate. It swallowed the light itself, casting the land into an unnatural twilight. "
        "The Star Needle’s reflection showed its hunger.\n\n"
        "His horse grew restless as villagers screamed in the distance. And then, from Sundrift’s heart, the first survivors ran toward him—"
        "eyes wild with terror, gasping: 'They’re all dead!'"
