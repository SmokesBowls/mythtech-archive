        "As the survivors fled past, the rider’s horse reared. Behind them came the horror—"
        "a reptilian warrior, towering and brutal, its slitted eyes locking on the rider with chilling interest.\n\n"
        "Yet just beyond the chaos, something stranger unfolded. A young woman sat perfectly still amidst the burning chaos, cross-legged and unbothered. "
        "Beside her stood a confused young man—guarding her, uncertain. Then—motion. A reptilian collapsed, its head rolling without a visible strike.\n\n"
        "The rider's grip on the reins tightened as something stirred in his palm. Blood welled again. Vision sharpened. Time slowed. "
        "Power coursed through him, not learned but remembered. The Star Needle pulsed again—echoing something ancient flowing through him."
