        "Inside Rowan's shop, the rider observed shelves of practical goods and the heat from a nearby forge. "
        "A bowl of water on the counter caught his attentionâ€”its faint crimson hue glinting in the right light. "
        "Their conversation turned to the sacred pool, hidden beneath the Star Needle. Though Rowan was skeptical, "
        "the rider's curiosity deepened. The transaction concluded without further words, but the encounter left a mark."
