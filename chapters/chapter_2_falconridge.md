Part 2 FalconRidge

The climb to Falcon Ridge leaves everyone exhausted, but alive. Two figures emerge from the shadows - a man with a drawn longbow and a woman wielding twin daggers. Below, the Warlord has stopped advancing, its massive form silhouetted against Sundrift's flames. Watching. Waiting.

"They're with us," Garic calls out, his voice carrying the weight of the night's events. "Let them through, Jorik."

The hunter - Jorik Longstride - lowers his bow but keeps watching the darkness behind you. His companion, Thalia SwiftBay, moves to help support Isla, who's still unsteady despite your strange healing.

"We saw the shadow fall," Thalia says, guiding people toward makeshift shelters. "Started gathering supplies immediately. Good thing too - you're not the first to make it up here."

The Star Needle's glow is distant now, but you can still feel its pulse matched in your blood. The Warlord's presence lingers in your mind - not the terror of a monster, but the weight of recognition. As if it saw something in you that you're only beginning to suspect.

Something that makes even giants pause.

Your palm throbs where the reins cut it, where that impossible power first awakened. In the valley below, the perfect water channels still gleam, their pattern suddenly familiar - like veins carrying ancient power through the earth itself.

You don't know yet that this is both beginning and end.
That power awakened isn't always power gained.
That some destinies are written in blood, but not all blood flows toward victory.

Tran and Keen return as silently as they left, materializing from the darkness. Their presence changes something in the air - as if until now, everyone had been holding their breath. Jorik nods at them before shouldering his bow. "I'll circle the perimeter," he says. "Better to be sure."

"I'm Keen," she says, studying you with curious eyes that seem to see too much. "And this is—"

A reptilian bursts from the underbrush, smaller than the others but no less deadly. Your hand goes to your weapon instantly, that same surge of power from before tingling in your veins... but nothing happens. No blood whip, no strange force—just normal combat reflexes as you slash at the creature.

The strike connects normally, causing damage but nothing like before. For a moment, you're confused—why isn't it working? The Star Needle's pulse feels distant now, the power that flowed so freely before now maddeningly out of reach.

But there's no time to dwell as Tran and Keen move to flank the reptilian. Together, you make quick work of it. The way they fight - it's like watching something predetermined, a dance choreographed ages ago.

"Well," Thalia says, emerging from the shadows. "That's one way to make introductions."

Keen resumes as if nothing happened. "As I was saying—this is Tran. We saw what you did back in Sundrift, helping Isla and the others."

"We need to discuss our next move," Garic interrupts, gathering everyone around a makeshift fire pit. But his eyes keep coming back to your bloodied palm, to the way the Star Needle's light seems to catch in the dried crimson there.

The fire in the sky comes without warning - brilliant streaks that tear through the shadow-darkened heavens, arcing over distant peaks before crashing somewhere beyond sight. The entire ridge watches in stunned silence. Even the Star Needle's distant pulse seems to falter.

"Those aren't normal meteors," Thalia says, her scout's eyes narrowing.

Tran steps forward, already checking his gear. "We need to investigate. Whatever those things are, they could be important."

But Keen remains still, her gaze fixed on the huddled survivors. You notice how the firelight catches in her eyes - not reflecting, but almost... absorbing. "These people need protection," she says quietly. "Someone needs to stay, help organize defenses. Build something here."

Tran looks at her, years of trust passing between them in a single glance. "You're sure?"

She nods, that same serene certainty from before settling over her features. "Go. Find answers. I'll make sure there's something to come back to."

You find yourself checking your own supplies, the strange power from earlier still thrumming beneath your skin. Whatever fell from the sky, it feels important. Connected. Your blood remembers something about that light, even if you don't.

"I'll go with Tran," you hear yourself say.

And just like that, the party forms. Not with ceremony or fanfare, but with purpose. As you and Tran prepare to depart, neither of you can know what awaits - or that the one being sought stands right here, choosing a different path.

[Tran has joined the party]

They follow the fire trails in tense silence at first, each lost in their own thoughts. The shadow still hangs overhead, making the glowing embers in the distance their only reliable guide.

"Back there," Tran finally says, careful with his words. "When Keen was... sitting. You saw that, didn't you?"

"The reptilian passing through her like smoke?" You adjust your grip on your weapon, remembering. "Hard to miss."

Tran nods slowly. "Never seen anything like that before."

"The one that fell without being touched," you add. "No weapon, no attacker. Just... fell."

A long pause follows. You think about your own experience—the blood, the healing, the power that surged through you. But something holds you back from mentioning it.

"All those warnings about magic growing up," Tran says, almost to himself. "The elders always said it was evil. Dangerous. But they talked about it like it was real."

"Had to come from somewhere," you observe. "People don't fear things that don't exist."

"Garic used to say magic was like a storm—powerful, unpredictable. Better to stay inside than test your luck." Tran kicks a stone from the path. "Never thought I'd see it with my own eyes though."

"Makes you wonder what else they weren't telling us."

"Or what else they didn't know themselves."

The conversation fades as you spot the first pieces of wreckage ahead. Neither of you has explained everything you saw—or did. But there's an understanding now, a shared suspicion that every warning, every whispered tale about magic, might have held more truth than anyone realized.

As you and Tran step into the clearing, the air around you shimmers strangely - like heat rising from sun-baked stone. The shimmer intensifies, and suddenly, five distinct figures materialize in a perfect circle around you.

One clothed in rippling blue, their form shifting like the surface of a disturbed pond.
Another seated on a stone that rises from the earth, clothed in earthy green.
A third wreathed in dancing flames, clothed in vibrant red.
A fourth barely visible, their white form more suggestion than substance.
And a fifth with eyes filled with stars, clothed in deepest violet.

"The blood burns with recognition," says the figure in red, flames dancing between their fingers.

Tran tenses beside you, his hand moving to his weapon. "Who are you?"

"We are the keepers," the figure in blue answers, their form rippling.
"The watchers," continues the green figure, drumming fingers against their stone seat.
"The testers," adds the red figure, flames dancing between their fingertips.
"The guides," whispers the white figure, voice circling with subtle mischief.
"The binders," finishes the violet figure, star-filled eyes fixed on Tran.

"We serve the one who flew into the Sun," they say in unison, their voices harmonizing in ways that shouldn't be possible.

The air between you splits open, reality itself parting like a curtain. Through this impossible tear, you glimpse a structure that defies comprehension – a vast library suspended in clouds, its architecture shifting and rearranging as if alive. Books and scrolls float through chambers with no apparent floor or ceiling, knowledge unbound by physical laws.

"The Akashic Records," the violet figure intones, starlight dancing in their eyes. "Where all knowledge is preserved. Where all journeys are remembered."

"Where the veil between worlds grows thin," adds the white figure, their whisper somehow carrying over the sudden rush of wind from the portal.

Tran stares transfixed at the library. "I've seen this before," he murmurs. "In dreams I could never remember upon waking."

"The path to understanding begins here," the green figure says, the stone beneath them cracking as roots spiral outward. "Your progress, your discoveries, your growth - all preserved within the Records."

The red figure's flames form miniature scenes of battle and triumph. "Return here when you need guidance, when you seek rest, when knowledge of the world's true nature eludes you."

"The Library remembers what you cannot," the blue figure promises, their form rippling with possibilities. "It will illuminate the dark places of memory and chronicle your journey."

You feel drawn to the shimmering gateway, your blood responding to its call. As you step closer, images flash through the portal – scenes from Sundrift, the water channels glowing with ancient power, the Star Needle's pulse, your own blood whip manifestation – perfectly preserved moments captured by unseen watchers.

"Shall we show you more?" the violet figure asks, extending a hand toward the gateway. "A glimpse of what awaits, a moment of respite before the journey ahead?"

You look to Tran, who seems both frightened and eager, his Crimson Blood visibly pulsing beneath his skin in response to the Library's presence.

"Just a glimpse," he says finally. "We still need to reach the crash site."

As you both step toward the portal, the five figures begin to fade – the blue dissolving into ripples, the green sinking into the earth, the red dispersing into embers, the white scattering like seeds on wind, and the violet lingering longest, their starlit gaze following you as you cross the threshold into the realm of perfect memory.

The Akashic Records embrace you fully as you step inside. The sensation is strange – like being submerged in a warm pool of knowledge while simultaneously floating weightless among stars. Time stops. The urgency of your mission fades momentarily as the Library acknowledges your presence.

A large tome materializes before you, its pages blank save for the first few entries. You see your name written in a script you recognize yet have never learned. Beneath it, images of Sundrift, the Star Needle, and your encounter with the reptilians.

"Touch the page," whispers the lingering voice of the violet Mika. "Bind your journey to the Records."

Your hand moves almost of its own accord, fingers brushing against the parchment. Your blood resonates, a single drop appearing on your fingertip without pain, absorbed instantly by the page. The ink glows, the writing becomes permanent, and you feel an undeniable sense of security – as if this moment has been preserved beyond the reach of time itself.

Tran follows suit, his Crimson Blood creating intricate patterns as it merges with the page. "It's done," he says quietly. "Our story is anchored here."

Around you, doorways beckon to different chambers – a map room with spaces yet unfilled, a bestiary showing only the reptilians you've faced, a music hall echoing faintly with Sundrift's ambient sounds. Knowledge waiting to be discovered, chambers waiting to be filled.

"Remember the way back," the collective voice of the Mikas whispers. "When the path grows dark, when danger overwhelms, the Records will welcome your return."

With reluctance, you both step back through the portal, reality reasserting itself as you find yourselves once again at the edge of the crash site. The journey ahead remains, but now with the certainty that your progress is preserved within the timeless Library.

As if time itself refuses to touch them," Tran finished. "I've seen these before. They're connected to beings called the Mikas - five figures who showed me and Viên something... incredible." The Crimson Blood in his veins pulsed in response, recognizing the ancient presence that had guided him once before.
"You know where they lead?" Caelum asked.
"No," Tran admitted. "Before, they appeared briefly and took us somewhere else entirely. But these..." he gestured at the trail leading along the water channels, "these are clearly meant to be followed."

The Akashic Records wait, ready to record what comes next.

The wreckage comes into view through the trees—twisted metal still glowing faintly in places. But it's the two reptilian warriors that draw their attention. Something's... wrong with their movement.

"Are they..." you start to ask.

"They're moving," Tran whispers, "but..." He squints. "Why is it taking them so long to reach the crash?"

You watch, trying to make sense of it. The reptilians are definitely advancing toward the wreckage, but each step seems to take an eternity. Like walking through invisible honey.

Tran catches your eye, motions toward a flanking position. You nod, understanding the plan without words. If they're somehow sleeping standing up, this might be the perfect chance for an ambush.

You circle wide through the brush, getting into position. Tran has a clear view of your approach. Just a few more steps and—

Your body freezes mid-lunge. Not fear, not hesitation—something else. Each muscle locked in place, caught between one heartbeat and the next. You can't even turn your head.

Through the corner of your eye, you see one of the reptilian's arms suddenly jerk to full speed, its head thrashing in panic despite its body remaining almost stationary. Then you spot it—a shadow in the wreckage moving. No, not a shadow. Someone controlling shadows. A girl, arms outstretched, trembling with exhaustion.

Was this... magic?

The thought barely forms before everything explodes into motion. The girl collapses. The reptilians surge forward, free of whatever held them. The massive one towers over her fallen form - until Tran slams into it, driving it back into a jagged piece of wreckage that pierces its leg.

Your own movement returns just in time to complete your original strike, your blade finding the second reptilian's throat. In one fluid motion, you're beside Tran, both of you facing the impaled creature, then each other, then the mysterious girl.

"Who are you?" Tran demands. "What was that you were doing?"

Real magic. Not just glimpses and guesses like in Sundrift. Not the strange surging of your blood or Keen's mysterious power. This was actual, controlled, impossible magic.

The girl remains on her knees, exhausted but watching you both with wary eyes. That's when you realize something - that shadow magic hadn't just been aimed at the creatures.

"You tried to trap us too," you say, keeping your blade ready.

The impaled reptilian gives one final twitch before going still. In the sudden quiet, you realize something—that shadow magic hadn't just been aimed at the creatures.

"You tried to trap us too," you say, keeping your blade ready. The girl remains on her knees, exhausted but watching you both with wary eyes.

Tran shifts his stance slightly. Not attacking, but not lowering his guard either. "That's an interesting way to thank people who just saved your life."

"Had to... be sure," she manages between breaths. Her voice is quiet but steady. "Couldn't tell if you were... with them."

"So you thought you'd just freeze us all and sort it out later?" Your grip tightens on your weapon. After everything in Sundrift, after seeing what magic can do, this doesn't feel like a moment for trust.

She looks up at you both, shadows still writhing faintly around her fingers. "Would you have preferred I let you get closer first?"

A twig snaps in the darkness. Then another. You both stop, weapons ready. Shapes emerge from the shadows—more reptilians, at least six of them. They've been waiting.

"Think we can handle this many?" you ask, backing up against Tran.

The answer comes in a wave of dark energy that pulses through the clearing. The reptilians stagger, their movements suddenly sluggish. Shadowy chains erupt from the ground, wrapping around two of them.

She steps into view, looking stronger than before. No trembling now, no exhaustion. Just controlled power as shadows dance around her fingers.

"I thought you might need help," Rongtai says simply.

The battle unfolds in a storm of blades and shadows. Rongtai's power flows with controlled precision now, each shadow strike deliberate and deadly. Between Tran's blade work and your instinctive movements, the reptilians fall one by one.

The last reptilian falls. There's a moment of silence as the shadows settle.

"That was..." Tran pauses, choosing his words carefully. "Thank you."

"Rongtai," she says, finally introducing herself. Her movements are more fluid now, controlled. "And you are?"

Brief introductions follow, tense but respectful. The immediate danger has passed, but questions linger in the air.

"I need somewhere to rest," she says. "Recover my strength. The crash... drained more than I expected."

You and Tran exchange a glance. The refugee camp is out of the question—too many people, too many fears about magic. But the old hideout...

"We know a place," Tran says finally. "Not comfortable, but safe. Away from prying eyes."

The walk to the hideout is quiet. Rongtai moves like a shadow herself, every step deliberate. You notice she keeps glancing at the moon, as if reading something in its light that you can't see.

At the hideout's entrance, Rongtai pauses. "Tomorrow," she says, "we should talk. About what's really happening. About why I'm here." Her eyes meet yours, then Tran's. "There are things you need to know."

"Get some rest," Tran replies, noncommittal. "We'll return in the morning."

As you and Tran walk away, the questions multiply. Who is she really looking for? What brought her here in that strange craft? And why does it feel like everything—the shadow, the giants, her arrival—is somehow connected?

The camp comes into view, makeshift fires dotting the ridge. Keen approaches first, followed by Garic and the others.

"We found the crash site," Tran reports. "And someone there. A woman, fighting reptilians. She... has abilities. Different ones."

Garic's expression darkens, but before he can speak, Thalia steps forward. "These aren't normal times," the scout says. "Giants walking the earth, shadows swallowing the sun. Maybe we need different allies."

"I know a place," Jorik adds quietly. "An old hideout. Good vantage point, away from the main camp. I can keep watch there tonight, make sure everything stays... calm."

You notice how carefully he chooses that last word. Not 'safe' - he's offering to watch over Rongtai as much as watch out for her.

"Tomorrow," Tran says, meeting Keen's questioning gaze. "We'll sort everything out tomorrow."

The camp settles in for the night, but the air feels charged with unspoken questions. Tomorrow will bring answers - or at least, the ones they're ready to hear.

The following Morning.The hideout is empty.

Tran looks around the abandoned space, frowning. "Well, at least we don't have to figure out what to do with her."

You both return to Falcon Ridge, where the news of a missing magic user brings more relief than concern. But then Isla's voice cuts through the morning air:

"Has anyone seen Keen?"

A deep rumble splits the sky. Everyone looks up as a shadow passes overhead - but this isn't like yesterday's darkness. This is something else. Metal gleams against the dawn sky as what remains of Rongtai's ship rises, rapidly becoming smaller against the clouds.

Something small flutters down, caught in the ship's wake. A piece of Keen's clothing lands near the edge of camp.

"The crash site," Tran says, already moving. "Now."

The crash site stretches before them, transformed by daylight into something alien and strange. Scorch marks paint the earth where Rongtai's ship tore free of gravity's chains. Among the scattered debris, a faint blinking draws their attention - some kind of device, half-buried but somehow still alive.

"Hello! How may I assist you today?"

The voice is cheerful, incongruous against their grim purpose. Beyond it, through a gap in the treeline, destiny waits in the form of a rusted passenger cart, its bulk jutting from an overgrown tunnel entrance.

Somewhere above, Keen is being carried toward an unknown fate. Below, ancient paths beckon through the darkness. And in between, blood pulses with power not yet understood.

You don't know yet that this is both beginning and end.
That power awakened isn't always power gained.
That some destinies are written in blood, but not all blood flows toward victory.

The countdown has begun.
