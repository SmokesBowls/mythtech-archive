Chapter 14

Viên's Growing Obsession
As they navigate toward the dormant spire, Viên keeps experiencing temporal flashes - glimpses of massive obsidian figures with cracked skin glowing with arcane light. He starts sketching these visions in the volcanic ash, muttering about "the eldest blood" and "void kinship."
When Keen questions him, he's evasive, simply saying: "There's something on Umbrageous... something connected to what I am. I can feel it calling across the void."
His behavior becomes increasingly erratic as they get closer to activating the Void Spire. He begins to prioritize speed over safety, willing to take dangerous risks to reach Umbrageous faster.
The Epic Battle on Pyroclast
Just as Keen and Viên reach the dormant Void Spire, they're ambushed by a coordinated applicator assault. The battle unfolds across multiple tiers of a massive volcanic caldera:

Keen must maintain her spiritual form to protect them from poison gases while fighting
Viên's temporal abilities allow him to predict lava eruptions, but his concentration keeps slipping as visions of the Shadowborn intensify
The applicators have adapted to the volcanic environment, using the magma flows as weapons

The climactic moment comes when a massive Pyroclast Titan - a mountain-sized creature of living stone and magma - rises from the central volcano, disturbed by the conflict. Its appearance forces a temporary alliance between Keen, Viên, and the applicators as they all struggle to survive.
During the chaos, Viên makes a desperate move to activate the Void Spire, channeling his Draco essence directly into its core despite Keen's warnings. The spire activates, but the process enhances Viên's connection to whatever awaits on Umbrageous, making his obsession even stronger.
Arrival on Umbrageous
The Void Spire transports them to Umbrageous - a world of perpetual twilight where the sun died long ago. The landscape is alien and haunting - twisted forests with bioluminescent vegetation, vast plains of ash, and distant mountain ranges that seem to shift when not directly observed.
As they orient themselves, they hear a deep, rhythmic pounding - like massive heartbeats. From the shadows emerges their first Shadowborn Giant - a towering Aetherbark from the Verdant Lineage, its cracked obsidian skin glowing with green ethereal light.
Instead of attacking, it regards them with pupilless void eyes and speaks directly into their minds: "The Temporal One returns to us at last. The Fractured Court has awaited this moment for eons."
To Keen's shock, Viên responds in a language she's never heard before, seeming to instinctively understand the giant. When he turns to her, his eyes have changed - now reflecting the same void-like quality as the Shadowborn.
"Keen," he says, his voice resonating oddly, "I think I've found my people."
Before any further explanation, the ground trembles. In the distance, a massive battle is unfolding between Pyrelord Giants and what appears to be a full-scale applicator invasion force. The applicators have reached Umbrageous ahead of them.
The Aetherbark extends a massive hand: "Come. The Hollowbloods have allied with the metal-minds. The Sundered Spine burns once more. If the Eclipseborn reach the Dead God's Heart, all worlds will fall
