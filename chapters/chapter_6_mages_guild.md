chapter 6 Mages Guild

Tran stood amidst the wreckage, his breath heavy and his Crimson Blood magic still humming in his veins. He could feel the Star Needle's power coursing through him, a constant reminder of his new responsibilities. Yet, as the dust settled and the reality of his situation began to sink in, he couldn't help but feel a profound sense of loneliness.
Keen was gone, Vein with her, and here he was, left behind to defend a village that seemed to be changing before his very eyes. Even Garic, once a steadfast ally, now regarded him with a mix of awe and uncertainty.
Tran sighed, forcing himself to focus on the task at hand. He had a job to do, and he couldn't afford to let his emotions cloud his judgment

Tran stood at the edge of one of the geometric water channels, watching his reflection ripple in the precisely engineered flow. The Crimson Blood in his veins pulsed in perfect rhythm with the Star Needle's distant glow. Each beat reminded him of those final moments with Viên - a stranger he'd known for mere hours, yet whose absence left an inexplicable void, as if some ancient connection had been severed.
The power flowing through the channels felt different now. Keen was gone too, taken to the Moon Kingdom, and here he stood, bound to the Star Needle by his own blood. The stranger who'd appeared in their hour of need had vanished just as quickly, yet Tran could still feel some echo of their shared heritage, even if he didn't understand it yet.
Through the channels, he sensed movement at the village perimeter. More refugees, probably. But his thoughts kept returning to that profound sense of loss - not of an old friend, but of a connection that had barely begun to form before being torn away.

Tran closed his eyes, allowing the water's steady rhythm to center him. The newcomers could wait; he needed a moment to reconcile his swirling emotions. His connection to Viên, the one who shared his Crimson Blood, was unlike anything he'd experienced. Their blood had reacted to each other's presence, igniting a power that felt ancient and primal.

Keen's departure was a different kind of loss. She'd been his constant companion, a source of light in a world that often felt too dark. Her absence left him feeling unbalanced, uncertain. He knew she had a greater purpose, but the knowledge did little to ease the ache in his heart.

The whispers of the water grew more urgent, pulling Tran from his reverie. He sighed, opening his eyes to the stark reality before him. His role as protector of the village had never felt heavier, the burden weighing on him like the stones beneath his feet.

He turned away from the channel, heading toward the source of the disturbance. He couldn't afford to dwell on what was lost. There were people here who needed him, and the Moon Kingdom would ensure Keen's safety. As for Viên... Tran hoped their paths would cross again, but for now, he had a duty to fulfill.

Stepping through the village, he caught snippets of hushed conversation - whispers of awe and fear mingled in equal measure. He couldn't blame them. With Keen gone and the full extent of Tran's powers on display, he knew he was now an unknown entity to them, a figure as enigmatic as the Star Needle itself.

Approaching the village perimeter, Tran steeled himself for what was to come. He was no longer just a protector; he was the embodiment of the Star Needle's power. And as he looked upon the sea of hopeful, fearful faces, he knew his life would never be the same again.

Tran's heart raced as he considered the possibility. If he could reach the Moon Kingdom, he could reunite with Keen and ensure her safety. But his duty was to protect the Star Needle and the village. Could he risk leaving them vulnerable?
His thoughts were interrupted by the commotion between the ambassadors and the Ironspire guards. He couldn't make out their words, but the tension was palpable. The girl, Elara, was trying to get a closer look, but Ulric kept pulling her back. Tran recognized Ulric as one of the village's most formidable warriors, his cybernetic augmentations glinting in the light.
Just then, one of the ambassadors noticed Tran and approached him. "Greetings," the ambassador said, his voice deep and resonant. "I am Veylan Solon, and this is Syvanna D'Reth. We're here to establish the Mages Guild on Earth."
Tran nodded, still distracted by the ship. "I know," he replied. "But tell me, can your ship reach the Moon Kingdom?"
Veylan raised an eyebrow, his feline features giving him a regal appearance. "It can," he said slowly. "But why do you ask?"
Tran hesitated, unsure how much to reveal. "I have a friend there," he said finally. "Someone who needs my help."
Veylan and Syvanna exchanged a glance. "We understand the importance of aiding those we care about," Syvanna said, her luminous markings shimmering softly. "But our mission here is crucial. The Mages Guild must be established on Earth to combat the growing threats."
Tran felt a surge of frustration. He knew they were right, but the thought of Keen alone on the Moon Kingdom weighed heavily on him. He clenched his fists, the Crimson Blood in his veins pulsing in response.
Just then, Ulric approached them, his eyes narrowed. "We don't need your magic here," he growled. "Ironspire has survived without it for centuries."
Tran could sense the animosity between Ulric and the ambassadors, the tension hanging thick in the air. He knew that navigating these political conflicts would be crucial in the days ahead. But first, he had to make a decision. Would he stay and protect the Star Needle, or would he risk everything to reach Keen?

"The Moon Kingdom," Veylan said, his gaze sharpening. "You bear the mark of the Star Needle's binding. To leave now could be... dangerous."
Before Tran could respond, an argument erupted between the Ironspire guards and Syvanna. Through the water channels, Tran felt a surge of power - Syvanna was doing something, some kind of magic that made the guards step back instinctively.
"Elara!" Ulric's voice cracked like a whip. The girl had slipped closer during the commotion, her eyes wide with fascination at the display of magic.
Tran watched her reaction carefully. There was something in her gaze - not fear, but recognition. As if she'd seen magic before, or perhaps...
"The ship cannot help you now," Veylan said quietly to Tran. "But there may be another way. Help us establish the Guild, and we'll help you find a path to the Moon Kingdom that won't compromise your binding."

Veylan studied Tran carefully, sensing the powerful connection binding him to the Star Needle. "Your loyalty to this place is profound," he said quietly. "But loyalty sometimes means preparing for what's to come, not just protecting what already exists."
Syvanna stepped forward, her luminous markings casting soft patterns on the ground. "The Star Needle isn't just a location," she added. "It's a key to something larger. Leaving it doesn't mean abandoning it."

"What do you mean?" Tran asked, his brow furrowed in confusion.
"The Star Needle is more than just a structure," Veylan explained carefully. "It's part of something larger - channels of power that span the Earth itself. Channels that have been dormant for centuries."
Syvanna stepped closer, her luminous markings pulsing softly. "Your binding to the Needle... it's not a chain, Tran. It's a key. But using it correctly will take time, preparation."
Tran felt the Crimson Blood surge in his veins at her words. Through the water channels, he sensed Elara edging closer again, despite Ulric's warnings. There was something about the girl's fascination with magic that nagged at him, but he pushed the thought aside.
"How long?" he asked, trying to keep the frustration from his voice. "Keen needs-"
"Keen is safer in the Moon Kingdom than you know," Veylan interrupted. "Help us establish the Guild first. Learn what the binding truly means. Then we can discuss reaching the Moon."
Tran looked back at the Star Needle, its pulse matching his own. He wanted to argue, to demand immediate passage, but he could feel the truth in Veylan's words. Whatever this binding was, he needed to understand it before trying to leave Earth.

With a heavy sigh, Tran nodded. "Alright," he conceded. "I'll help you establish the Guild. But I need your word that we'll find a way to reach Keen."
"You have my word," Veylan replied solemnly. "But first, we must understand what your binding truly means."
Through the water channels, Tran felt Elara's presence again, edging closer despite her father's warnings. There was something about her movement - careful, deliberate, as if she'd practiced staying hidden.
"Elara!" Ulric's voice cut through the air again, harder this time. "I won't tell you again. Get back inside!"
But before the girl could retreat, one of the water channels pulsed unexpectedly, responding to... something. Tran caught a glimpse of surprise on Syvanna's face before she masked it.
"We should begin preparations," Veylan said smoothly, drawing attention away from the moment. "The Guild's foundation cannot wait."
Ulric's expression darkened. "Keep your magic away from my daughter," he growled, finally succeeding in pulling Elara away.
As they walked away, Tran couldn't shake the feeling that something significant had just happened - something that neither the ambassadors nor Ulric wanted to acknowledge.

"A matter of diplomacy requires attention," Veylan said, his feline features catching the fading light. "I must present our case to Lord Stormhelm of Ironspire, and I believe your presence would be... significant."
Tran felt the Star Needle's pulse quicken slightly at the mention of travel. "I'm bound to the Needle now. I don't know if I can-"
"The binding is not a chain," Veylan interrupted smoothly. "It's a connection. One that will hold whether you're beside the Needle or standing before Ironspire's gates. Besides," his tone grew more serious, "Ironspire's leadership needs to understand that magic users aren't their enemies. Who better to demonstrate that than someone who protects their own people?"
Through the water channels, Tran sensed Syvanna guiding the curious Elara away from their conversation. The girl's presence nagged at him for some reason he couldn't quite grasp.
"How long would we be gone?" Tran asked, already feeling the weight of the decision.
"Three days, at most. And Syvanna will remain here to protect the Star Needle in your absence."

Tran closed his eyes, feeling the Needle's energy through the water channels. The thought of walking away from it, even temporarily, made his Crimson Blood surge with uncertainty. But Veylan was right - if they wanted to establish the Guild, they needed Ironspire's cooperation, or at least their tolerance.
"The channels extend far beyond Sundrift," Tran said, opening his eyes. "I can feel them stretching toward Ironspire, though they're... different there. Older, maybe."
Veylan nodded, a glint of interest in his eyes. "The ancient waterways hold many secrets. Perhaps this journey will reveal some of them."
"When do we leave?"
"First light," Veylan replied. "The path to Ironspire is not kind to nighttime travelers. And Tran..." he paused, choosing his words carefully. "Lord Stormhelm's people will be watching for any sign of magic use. We must tread carefully."
Through the channels, Tran felt Syvanna beginning preparations for their departure, her magic a subtle ripple in the water's flow. Beyond her, at the edge of his awareness, he sensed Elara watching from the shadows, her father's warnings forgotten in her curiosity.

Dawn broke over Falcon Ridge, casting long shadows through the mist. Tran stood at the edge of the water channels, feeling their steady pulse mixing with his own Crimson Blood. The further channels called to him now, like distant whispers.
Veylan approached silently, his travel gear minimal but pristine. No signs of his magical nature showed - he looked every bit the diplomatic envoy he was pretending to be.
"The eastern road should take us there by nightfall," Veylan said quietly.
As they began walking, Tran felt the Star Needle's pulse grow fainter, but not weaker. The connection stretched like a thread, maintaining its grip on his blood even as the distance grew. Through the channels, he sensed Syvanna beginning her own work with the Guild's establishment.
The road to Ironspire lay ahead, its path cutting through territories Tran had only heard stories about. Neither of them spoke much as they walked - Veylan seemed lost in diplomatic preparations, while Tran focused on adapting to this new extension of his binding.

The sun was setting when Ironspire's massive walls came into view, the Grand Spire rising behind them like a shadow of the Star Needle. Tran felt it immediately - a familiar resonance, but corrupted somehow. Through the water channels, he could sense how the Spire's energy was being... harnessed, contained, used in ways it wasn't meant to be.
"You feel it," Veylan observed quietly. "The similarity."
"Anunnaki," Tran said, the word coming to him instinctively through his blood. "Like the Needle, but... wrong."
Guards appeared at the gates, their armor gleaming with what Ironspire claimed was advanced engineering. But Tran could sense the truth - magic woven into metal, hidden behind technology.
"Remember," Veylan whispered as they approached the guards, "we're here to establish diplomatic relations, nothing more."

The guards inspected them with practiced suspicion. Through the water channels, Tran could sense how the Grand Spire's energy pulsed through Ironspire's foundations - Anunnaki technology masked as engineering advancement. But there was something else too, something deeper, like a wrongness he couldn't quite place.
"State your business," the lead guard demanded, his armor subtly enhanced with what Ironspire would call "advanced metallurgy" but Tran now recognized as woven magic.
"I am Veylan Solon, here to speak with Lord Stormhelm on matters of trade and diplomacy," Veylan replied smoothly. "And this is Tran, a representative from the Sundrift region."
Tran noticed how Veylan carefully avoided any mention of magic or the Guild. As the guards deliberated, he caught glimpses of Ironspire's factions through gaps in the walls - the disciplined Ironguard patrols, robed figures of the Silver Flame hurrying past, Circle of Progress members carrying strange devices.

The gates groaned open just enough to admit them. Inside, Ironspire was a maze of metal and stone, the Grand Spire looming overhead like a dark mirror of the Star Needle. Markets and forges buzzed with activity, but Tran noticed how segregated everything seemed - each faction keeping to their own territory.
Ironguard patrols moved with military precision, their enhanced armor gleaming. Members of the Circle of Progress hurried past with strange devices, while Order of the Silver Flame priests watched everything from their temple steps. In the shadows between it all, Tran caught glimpses of people who could only be Red Hand operatives, though they vanished the moment he noticed them.
"Lord Stormhelm will see you at sunset," their escort announced. "Until then, you'll be shown to your quarters. Do not wander."
Through the water channels beneath the city, Tran could feel that wrongness pulsing stronger. Something about how the Anunnaki technology was being used here felt... corrupted.
Veylan caught his eye and gave a subtle shake of his head. Now wasn't the time to investigate.

As they followed their escort through Ironspire's streets, a commotion near the military quarter drew their attention. A crowd had gathered to watch what appeared to be a training demonstration, but what Tran saw made him stop in his tracks.
A warrior atop a midnight-black horse moved through combat forms with impossible grace. Horse and rider seemed to move as one, their movements too perfectly synchronized to be normal cavalry training. Through the water channels, Tran sensed something else - a pulse of magic different from both the Anunnaki tech above and the wrongness below.
"Caelum and Onyx," Veylan murmured. "I didn't expect to find them here."
The horse - Onyx - suddenly turned its head toward them, its eyes showing an intelligence that made Tran's Crimson Blood stir in recognition. The warrior, Caelum, followed his mount's gaze, his expression shifting from focused to curious.
"Keep moving," their escort ordered, but there was tension in his voice. Even Ironspire's guards seemed unsure how to handle the duo's presence.

Caelum guided Onyx closer, ignoring the escort's obvious discomfort. Up close, Tran could see the subtle markings on both warrior and mount - not quite Anunnaki tech, but not pure Earth magic either. Something unique.
"You carry old power," Caelum said quietly, his words meant only for Tran and Veylan. Onyx's intelligent gaze seemed to look straight through Tran's defenses, sensing the Crimson Blood.
"As do you," Veylan replied diplomatically.
A ghost of a smile crossed Caelum's stern features. "Our paths will cross again. When they do..." he glanced meaningfully at the Grand Spire, "we'll have much to discuss."
"Time to go," the escort insisted, more firmly this time.
As they moved on, Tran felt Onyx's presence in the water channels - a ripple of power that suggested there was far more to the duo than even this display had shown.

The audience chamber was designed to intimidate - soaring metallic arches that caught the last rays of sunset through high windows, guards positioned at precise intervals, and the Grand Spire's pulse feeling strongest here. Lord Stormhelm stood at a window, his back to them as they entered.
"Diplomatic envoys," he said without turning, "come to discuss trade. Yet one of you carries power that makes my sensors hum." Now he turned, fixing Tran with a calculating stare. "The Star Needle's champion, if I'm not mistaken."
Tran felt the corrupted Anunnaki energy swirling around them, masked as technological advancement. Through the water channels, he could sense how deeply it ran through Ironspire's foundations.
Veylan stepped forward smoothly. "We come seeking cooperation between our regions, my lord. The changing times demand new alliances."

"New alliances," Lord Stormhelm repeated, moving away from the window. "You speak of change, yet bring magic to my doorstep - the very force that once enslaved humanity."
"Technology and progress aren't so different from what you call magic, my lord," Veylan countered carefully. "Your own city stands as proof of that."
Stormhelm's eyes narrowed at the implication. "Ironspire's advancements are the result of engineering and innovation. Nothing more."
But Tran could feel the truth through the water channels - how the corrupted Anunnaki energy pulsed through the very floor beneath them, how it powered the "advanced" devices throughout the chamber. The Grand Spire's wrongness felt overwhelming here.
"We seek only to establish diplomatic relations," Veylan continued. "To ensure all our people's safety in these uncertain times."
"And what exactly," Stormhelm asked, his gaze shifting to Tran, "does the Star Needle's guardian think of this diplomatic mission?"

Tran met Lord Stormhelm's gaze, the Star Needle's pulse resonating through his veins like a second heartbeat. Through the water channels deep beneath their feet, he could feel the corrupted Anunnaki energy twisting through Ironspire's foundations—a dark mirror to the Star Needle's sacred geometry.

"Diplomacy requires truth," Tran began, choosing his words with the precision of a bloodblade. The Crimson Blood stirred in response to the Grand Spire's distorted energy, making the hair on his arms stand erect. "Your sensors hum because we share more than you acknowledge."

Veylan shot him a warning look, but Tran pressed on. He gestured to the vaulted arches above them, where the setting sun cast geometric shadows that mirrored Sundrift's water channel..

Tran met Stormhelm's gaze steadily. "The Star Needle stands as a beacon of protection for our people, just as your Grand Spire does for yours. But protection takes many forms."
He felt the water channels react to his words, their flow shifting subtly. Stormhelm's expression tightened - he'd noticed it too, though he tried to hide his reaction.
"Pretty words," Stormhelm said. "But Ironspire has survived centuries without outside interference. Why should we change that now?"
"Because what's coming won't care about our borders or beliefs," Tran replied, thinking of Keen, of the Moon Kingdom, of all he'd seen. "And when it arrives, standing alone may not be enough."
The corrupted energy beneath them surged, as if responding to the tension in the room. Stormhelm studied them both for a long moment before speaking.
"You may establish your... diplomatic presence in the outer quarter. But know that Ironspire's laws regarding unauthorized magic use remain absolute."

Stormhelm's words hung in the air, both a concession and a threat. Through the water channels, Tran sensed guards shifting positions outside the chamber, responding to unseen signals.
"Your generosity honors us," Veylan replied smoothly. "Of course, establishing proper quarters will require some construction. We've brought our own engineers to ensure everything meets Ironspire's... standards."
"Engineers." Stormhelm's smile didn't reach his eyes. "How convenient. And I suppose these engineers will need access to specific areas of the city?"
"Only what's necessary for proper integration with your existing infrastructure," Veylan assured him.
A subtle vibration ran through the water channels - something in the depths of Ironspire was drawing power from the Grand Spire, making its corrupted energy pulse stronger for a moment.
"You'll understand if we assign oversight to your project," Stormhelm said. "Captain Dorne will personally supervise your engineers' activities."
"Of course," Veylan nodded. "We welcome the cooperation."

The sun had long since set by the time they were escorted back through Ironspire's darkening streets. Torches cast shadows that seemed to dance between the factions' territories - Silver Flame priests hurrying to evening prayers, Circle of Progress members still tinkering with devices, Ironguard patrols growing more frequent in the night hours.
"That went as well as could be expected," Veylan murmured, keeping his voice low.
"The Grand Spire," Tran replied quietly. "During the meeting, something beneath the city was drawing power from it. Something that made the corruption worse."
A group of Red Hand merchants passed by, their casual glances too deliberate to be truly casual. Their escort's hand tightened on his weapon.
"We'll be shown to temporary quarters," Veylan said. "Tomorrow, we begin the real work of establishing our presence here. Though I suspect Captain Dorne's 'oversight' will make things... interesting."
The water channels whispered warnings about what lay beneath their feet, but Tran forced himself to focus on the immediate challenge. One step at a time.

Their assigned quarters were spartan but strategic - positioned where the territories of multiple factions overlapped. Through the water channels, Tran could feel the constant movement of patrols, both official and otherwise.
"We're being watched," Tran observed, sensing ripples of attention from various directions.
"By everyone," Veylan agreed, checking the room with practiced efficiency. "The Ironguard openly, the Red Hand from the shadows, the Circle of Progress through their devices, and the Silver Flame..." he glanced toward their window, where temple spires rose against the night sky, "through whatever means their prophecies provide."
A disturbance in the water channels caught Tran's attention - a surge of that corrupted energy from deep below, followed by the subtle shifting of guard patrols above. Something was happening beneath Ironspire, something that made his Crimson Blood pulse with warning.
"Get some rest," Veylan advised. "Tomorrow, the real negotiations begin."
But rest wouldn't come easily, not with the Grand Spire's wrongness pressing against his senses all night.

The Grand Spire cast long shadows across the city as Tran followed the water channels' flow. Each pulse revealed more of Ironspire's secrets - the way faction territories shifted during the night, how patrols adjusted their routes, where power flowed beneath the streets.
A knock at their door revealed Captain Dorne himself, his military bearing hiding something... cautious in his stance.
"Your engineers have arrived," he announced formally. "They await inspection at the outer gates."
Veylan nodded. "Of course. We'll need to survey the proposed construction site as well."
"The Lord Commander has approved three potential locations," Dorne replied. "All well within our security protocols."
Through the channels, Tran felt another surge from below - stronger this time, making the corrupted energy ripple through Ironspire's foundations. Captain Dorne's slight tensing suggested he felt something too, though he tried to hide it.

The engineers - four of them, each wearing the simple clothes of craftsmen - waited at the gates with measuring tools and documents. But Tran could sense the carefully hidden magic in their movements, the way they already traced the city's power flows with practiced eyes.
"This way," Captain Dorne led them to the first site, a cleared space near where the Circle of Progress territory met the merchant quarter. "Lord Stormhelm believes this location would best serve your... diplomatic needs."
One of the engineers began taking measurements, her movements precise but purposeful. Through the water channels, Tran felt how she was actually mapping the energy flows beneath the surface.
"The foundation here seems unstable," she announced, tapping her measuring rod against the ground. The vibration sent ripples through the channels, making the corrupted energy below pulse angrily.Dorne's hand tightened on his weapon. "Impossible. Our surveys-"
"Perhaps we should examine the other sites," Veylan interjected smoothly. "We wouldn't want to risk any structural issues."

"The second site," Dorne said stiffly, leading them toward the outer quarter. But before they could move far, another pulse erupted from below - stronger than before. This time, several of the Circle of Progress's nearby devices sparked in response.
One of the engineers stumbled, her measuring rod clattering to the ground. The sound seemed to echo through the water channels, creating a discordant rhythm with whatever was pulsing beneath the city.
"Just some interference from our power systems," Dorne said quickly - too quickly. "The Circle's experiments sometimes affect nearby equipment."
But Tran could feel the truth through the channels - this was no simple power surge. The corrupted energy below was reacting to something, growing more unstable with each pulse.
Veylan caught his eye with a subtle warning glance. Not here. Not now.

The second location sat closer to the Silver Flame territory, their temple spires looming overhead. Here, the water channels ran deeper, and the corrupted energy felt more distant - but somehow fouler, like it had fermented in the depths.
"The foundation here is more stable," one of the engineers noted, though her tools trembled slightly as another pulse rippled up from below.
Through the channels, Tran noticed how the Silver Flame priests had stopped their morning rituals to watch. Their attention felt heavy, deliberate. They knew something about what lay beneath their feet.
"The proximity to the temple district ensures constant surveillance," Dorne explained, misinterpreting their interest. "For security purposes, of course."
"Of course," Veylan agreed diplomatically. "Though perhaps the religious ceremonies might find our construction... disruptive?"
Before Dorne could respond, one of the Circle of Progress's devices exploded in a shower of sparks several streets away. The pulse that followed was the strongest yet.

The explosion drew guards running, their enhanced armor humming with barely concealed magic. Through the water channels, Tran felt the corrupted energy below churning like a storm about to break.
"A minor technical malfunction," Dorne insisted, but his hand hadn't left his weapon. "The Circle's experiments can be... unpredictable."
"Perhaps we should examine the third site another time," Veylan suggested, watching as more Circle members rushed toward the explosion. "Allow your people to handle this situation first."
But something in the water channels caught Tran's attention - a pattern in the pulses, like something trying to break through. The corrupted energy wasn't just reacting anymore. It was being used.
"Captain!" An Ironguard messenger sprinted up, face pale. "Lord Stormhelm requires your presence immediately. There's been an... incident in the lower levels."

The messenger's words made the corrupted energy surge again, as if responding to its own exposure. Dorne's expression hardened into something between anger and fear.
"We'll continue this inspection tomorrow," he said curtly. "Return to your quarters. The guards will escort you."
But as they turned to leave, Tran caught a glimpse of Caelum and Onyx watching from a shadowed alcove. The warrior's expression was grim, and his mount's intelligent eyes seemed to be trying to convey something about the pulses below.
Through the water channels, Tran felt the corruption spreading, seeping upward like poison through Ironspire's foundations. Whatever lay beneath the city was growing stronger, and these pulses weren't random - they were testing the barriers holding them back.
"This is more than just unstable foundations," Veylan murmured as they walked. "Something down there is awakening."
Their quarters felt different when they returned - the air heavier, the water channels more agitated. Guards posted outside their door couldn't hide their nervousness as another pulse shook through the foundations.
"The Circle of Progress claims their devices are detecting unprecedented energy readings," Veylan said quietly, once they were alone. "But they're looking in the wrong direction. Up at the Grand Spire, instead of down at what's beneath it."
Tran placed his hand against the wall, feeling the corrupted energy moving through the channels. "It's like watching something struggle against chains. Whatever they're doing down there..." He paused as another pulse rippled through. "They're not just using the power. They're trying to harvest it."
A shadow passed their window - one of the Red Hand's agents, moving too quickly to be casual. The whole city was on edge now, each faction preparing for whatever might come next.
"Tomorrow," Veylan said, "when we inspect the third site, we need to-"
A knock at their door cut him off. When they opened it, they found a sealed message bearing the Circle of Progress's mark.

Veylan broke the seal carefully, his feline features tightening as he read. "The Circle wants to meet. Privately. They claim to have data about the 'energy anomalies' that we should see."
Through the water channels, Tran felt another pulse, but this one was different - more focused, almost like it was searching for something. The corrupted energy swirled through Ironspire's foundations like a living thing.
"A trap?" Tran asked, though he already suspected the answer was more complicated.
"Perhaps. Or perhaps the Circle of Progress has realized they're dealing with forces beyond their understanding." Veylan set the message down. "They're requesting a meeting tonight, in their research quarter."
Below them, the searching pulse found something - a connection in the water channels that made Tran's Crimson Blood surge in warning. Whatever lay beneath Ironspire wasn't just corrupted Anunnaki technology anymore. It was evolving.

"The timing is suspicious," Veylan noted, glancing at the message again. "Just hours after the explosion, after Dorne was summoned away..."
Another pulse trembled through the channels, and this time Tran could feel how it resonated with specific points throughout the city - like nodes in a web. "They're not just studying the energy," he realized. "They're trying to map it. But they don't understand what they're really tracking."
"The Circle of Progress believes in their technology," Veylan said. "But what they're detecting..." He paused as shadows moved past their window - more Red Hand agents, watching the streets. "We can't ignore this invitation. Whatever's happening below Ironspire, the Circle might have information we need."
"Or they might expose us to Stormhelm," Tran countered, feeling how the corrupted energy seemed to coil around certain parts of the city like a serpent. "Everything in this city has multiple purposes."
"Including us," Veylan reminded him with a slight smile.

"We'll split up," Veylan decided. "I'll meet with the Circle - they'll expect that from a diplomatic envoy seeking to understand their city's 'advanced technology.' You..." He glanced meaningfully at the floor. "The water channels might lead you to discover what's causing these pulses."
Tran felt the corruption twist through the channels again, like something testing its bonds. "The guards watch everything."
"Indeed. But their attention will be divided tonight. The Silver Flame begins their evening rituals soon, and the Red Hand seems particularly active." Veylan's expression grew serious. "Just remember - we're here to establish the Guild's presence, not expose Ironspire's secrets. Not yet."
Through the channels, Tran sensed another searching pulse, stronger than before. Whatever lay beneath Ironspire was growing bolder, more desperate. Or perhaps, more confident.
"Be careful," Tran said. "The Circle of Progress might understand more than they're letting on."

Night settled over Ironspire like a heavy cloak, the Grand Spire's shadow stretching across the city. Veylan departed first, his diplomatic robes making him conspicuous enough to draw the guards' attention. The perfect distraction.
Tran waited until the evening bells of the Silver Flame began tolling before moving. The water channels guided him through blind spots in the patrols, each pulse from below making his path clearer. The corrupted energy felt strongest near the old maintenance tunnels, where the Circle's power conduits disappeared into the depths.
He found an access point hidden behind maintenance panels, exactly where the channels suggested it would be. But as he prepared to descend, a voice froze him in place.
"Interesting choice of evening activity."
Tran turned to find Caelum standing in the shadows, Onyx's intelligent eyes gleaming in the darkness. The warrior's expression was unreadable, but he made no move to raise an alarm.

"You're looking for answers in the wrong place," Caelum said quietly, Onyx's intelligent eyes reflecting the dim light. "The Circle's conduits only skim the surface of what lies below."

"You know what's down there," Tran replied. It wasn't a question.

Caelum nodded once, his expression grave. "We've been tracking the corruption for months. It's growing stronger." He glanced at Onyx, some unspoken communication passing between them. "We can show you a better way in."

They moved through shadow-filled passages that even the water channels hadn't revealed to Tran, descending deeper than maintenance tunnels should go. The corruption grew stronger with each level they descended, the pulses more frequent, more insistent.

"The Circle thinks they're studying the Grand Spire's power," Caelum explained as they navigated a narrow passage. "They don't realize they're being studied in return."

Finally, they reached an ancient door inscribed with symbols that made Tran's Crimson Blood surge in recognition. Anunnaki script, but older than any he'd seen before.

"Beyond this point," Caelum warned, "nothing is as it seems."

The door opened to reveal a sight that stole Tran's breath. What had once been a massive chamber had transformed into a vast underground garden of bioluminescent life. Plants that shouldn't exist pulsed with inner light - blue, violet, and crimson veins threading through massive leaves and tendrils that climbed ancient columns.

"The Garden of First Light," Caelum said quietly. "Created when the Anunnaki first arrived on Earth."

The corrupted energy that had felt so wrong through the water channels was concentrated here, but Tran could now see its source - at the center of the garden stood a massive crystalline structure, part machine, part organic growth. With each pulse, the bioluminescent plants responded, their light dimming and brightening in unison.

"What is that?" Tran whispered, his Crimson Blood responding to the machine's rhythm.

"A Nexus Engine," Caelum replied. "Designed to channel power from the Grand Spire. But something's wrong with it."

As they moved closer, Tran saw what Caelum meant. The machine was corrupted, dark veins spreading through its crystalline surface like disease. And wrapped around it, almost merged with it, was a figure of pure light struggling against the corruption. 

"An Aeon Keeper," Tran realized, recognizing the being from ancient texts.

"Trying to contain the corruption," Caelum confirmed. "But failing. The Circle's experiments have weakened the barriers. They're trying to harvest power they don't understand."

The Aeon Keeper's form flickered as another pulse surged through the garden. The being's light dimmed further as the corruption spread deeper into its essence.

"We need to help it," Tran said, already moving forward.

But Caelum caught his arm. "The corruption is spreading to the Keeper itself. If we break the connection now..."

Tran understood the warning. The Aeon Keeper was becoming part of the corruption. Saving it wouldn't be as simple as severing its connection to the machine.

Onyx whinnied softly, a sound that carried strange harmonies through the garden. The bioluminescent plants around them dimmed in response, as if hiding from what was to come.

"We have to try," Tran insisted, the Crimson Blood in his veins surging with purpose.

As they approached the center of the garden, the Aeon Keeper's head turned toward them, its featureless face somehow conveying both hope and despair. Then its form convulsed as another pulse ripped through the chamber.

Tran reached out through the water channels, trying to connect with the being's essence. What he found made his blood run cold.

The corruption wasn't just affecting the Aeon Keeper. It was transforming it. Creating something new.

As they approached the corrupted Nexus Engine, the Aeon Keeper's form convulsed violently. The bioluminescent plants around them flared with sickly light, then abruptly dimmed as if drawing inward. The garden fell silent for one breathless moment.

"Something's wrong," Caelum whispered, his hand moving to his weapon.

The silence shattered as the Aeon Keeper let out a soundless scream that rippled through the water channels. Its once-pure light fractured with veins of corruption, its form twisting into something new and terrible. The being tore itself partially free from the Nexus Engine, but remained tethered by tendrils of dark energy.

"It's too late," Caelum said, backing away. "The corruption has reached its core."

The corrupted Keeper turned toward them, its faceless visage now split by a jagged line of darkness. It raised an arm, and a wave of corrupted energy surged through the garden, making the plants writhe and twist unnaturally.

"We need to sever its connection to the Nexus," Tran called out, the Crimson Blood in his veins surging in response to the threat.

The Keeper attacked without warning, launching tendrils of corrupted light that cut through the air like whips. Tran barely managed to dodge, feeling the energy sizzle past him. Caelum wasn't as fortunate—a tendril caught his shoulder, making him stagger backward with a grunt of pain.

Onyx reared up, neighing with fury, intelligent eyes locked on the corrupted being. Caelum recovered quickly, placing his hand on Onyx's flank.

"Stay back," he warned Tran. "We need to synchronize."

The water channels beneath them began to glow as Caelum and Onyx initiated whatever ritual they had planned. Tran circled the corrupted Keeper, drawing its attention away from the pair. The Crimson Blood in his veins responded to his need, flowing into the channels around him, creating a network of power that pushed back against the corruption.

Another wave of energy crashed through the garden, stronger than before. The Keeper was growing more desperate, more dangerous. Through the water channels, Tran could feel how the corruption was spreading, threatening to reach Ironspire's foundations above.

"Now!" Caelum shouted.

Tran turned to see something impossible—Caelum and Onyx merging, their forms flowing together in a surge of ancient magic. Where horse and rider had stood, now a magnificent centaur warrior rose, Caelum's upper body seamlessly joined with Onyx's powerful equine form. The centaur's coat gleamed with faint runic patterns, and in his hands he held a spear that shimmered with concentrated power.

"The connection," the centaur called in a voice that was both Caelum's and something older. "Attack the tethers while I hold it back!"

The centaur charged forward with impossible speed, the spear becoming a blur of light as it struck at the corrupted Keeper. The being screamed again, that silent cry tearing through the water channels. It focused its attacks on the centaur, giving Tran the opening he needed.

Tran reached deep into the water channels, drawing power through his Crimson Blood. He directed it like a blade, striking at the dark tendrils that connected the Keeper to the Nexus Engine. Each cut released a shower of corrupted energy that burned the air around it.

The battle raged through the bioluminescent garden, plants reacting to each surge of power by either flaring brightly or withdrawing into darkness. The centaur moved with fluid grace, striking with precision despite the corrupted Keeper's increasingly frantic attacks.

"The final tether," the centaur called out, deflecting another tendril with his spear. "Cut it now!"

Tran gathered every bit of power he could command, focusing it into a single strike. The Crimson Blood in his veins burned like fire as he drove his power into the last connection. For one terrible moment, nothing happened—then the tether shattered with an explosion of light and darkness.

The corrupted Keeper fell backward, separated from the Nexus Engine at last. The corruption seemed to recede slightly, but didn't vanish. Instead, it settled deeper into the being's form, becoming part of it rather than an external influence.

The garden grew quiet, the bioluminescent plants pulsing with a steadier rhythm. The centaur approached the fallen Keeper cautiously, spear still ready.

"Is it... dead?" Tran asked, joining him.

Before the centaur could answer, the being stirred. But what rose wasn't the Aeon Keeper anymore—nor was it the corrupted entity they had fought. Something new looked back at them through eyes that held both light and shadow.

It stood upright, its form still reminiscent of the Aeon Keeper but solid, physical in a way the Keeper had not been. Where there had been featureless radiance, now distinct features formed—a face that looked almost human, though too perfect to be truly of Earth.

"The tether is broken," it said, its voice carrying harmonies that made the garden's plants shiver. "But I am... changed."

The centaur lowered his spear slightly, but remained tense. "What are you now? Neither Keeper nor corruption?"

The being looked down at its hands, studying them as if seeing physical form for the first time. "I am... Nefaretti. That is the name that forms in what remains of the Keeper's consciousness." It looked up at them, its gaze penetrating. "But I am not bound to the Aeon Keepers anymore. Nor am I slave to the corruption."

Tran felt the water channels around them responding to this new entity, neither recoiling nor embracing it. The Crimson Blood in his veins sensed no immediate threat, but remained alert.

"The Nexus Engine," Tran said, glancing at the massive structure. "It's still corrupted."

Nefaretti turned to study the machine. "Yes. The corruption spreads beyond me now. It seeks to reach the surface, to corrupt the Grand Spire itself." It turned back to them, its expression solemn. "I can help you stop it. My connection to both the Keepers and the corruption gives me... perspective."

The centaur's form shimmered, separating back into Caelum and Onyx. Caelum stumbled slightly as his human form stabilized, then straightened.

"Why should we trust you?" he asked, still gripping his spear.

"Because I am like you now," Nefaretti replied. "Neither one thing nor another. A being of both worlds." It gestured at Caelum and Onyx. "You merge to become something greater than either alone. I was forced into a similar transformation." It turned to Tran. "And you—carrier of Crimson Blood—you too walk between worlds."

Tran exchanged a look with Caelum. The corruption still flowed through the Nexus Engine, still threatened Ironspire above. And Veylan was still meeting with the Circle, unaware of what they had discovered.

"If you truly want to help," Tran said finally, "then prove it. Help us contain the corruption in the Nexus Engine before it reaches the Grand Spire."

Nefaretti nodded, a gesture that seemed strangely human for a being born of such otherworldly origins. "I will. But know this—containing it is only the beginning. What lies beneath Ironspire is older and more dangerous than even the Aeon Keepers understood."

The garden's bioluminescent plants pulsed in agreement, casting shadows that seemed to hide secrets older than time itself.

Nefaretti moved toward the Nexus Engine, placing one hand on its corrupted surface. The dark veins seemed to recoil slightly from his touch.

"From this point forward, I will handle what needs to be handled," Nefaretti said, his voice resonating with newfound authority. "Don't come back down here until you're ready." He turned to look at Tran, his eyes reflecting both light and darkness. "Which you are not."

"What do you mean?" Tran asked, the Crimson Blood in his veins still unsettled by the garden's strange energies.

"Continue with your mission, your diplomacy," Nefaretti replied. "But do not return here. The corruption runs deeper than even the Aeon Keepers understood. Anunnaki technology was never meant to be used this way."

Caelum placed a hand on Tran's shoulder. "We should go. The Circle will be looking for answers about the energy fluctuations."

Tran hesitated, looking at the Nexus Engine. "Will you be safe here?"

A faint smile crossed Nefaretti's too-perfect features. "Safety is relative when dealing with forces this ancient. But I am uniquely suited to this task now." His form seemed to shimmer, the corruption within him responding to the engine's pulse. "We will meet again, Crimson Blood carrier. When the time is right."

"He's right," Caelum said quietly, already guiding Onyx toward the exit. "We've done what we can here."

With a final nod to Nefaretti, Tran followed them from the garden, the bioluminescent plants dimming as they passed, as if bowing to their departure.

---

The ascent through the hidden passages seemed quicker than their descent. By the time they reached the surface, dawn was breaking over Ironspire's walls. Tran realized with surprise that something fundamental had changed - the corrupted pulse that had haunted him since their arrival was gone. Not completely absent, but muted, contained.

"The city feels... different," he said as they emerged near the Silver Flame district.

Caelum nodded, already mounting Onyx. "He's containing it. For now." His expression remained guarded. "We should find your companion. The Circle's meeting would have ended hours ago."

They found Veylan waiting in their quarters, his expression carefully neutral until the door closed behind them.

"I was beginning to worry," the ambassador said, his feline features relaxing slightly. "The Circle's representatives were... enlightening. They believe they've discovered some kind of power source beneath the city. Something they can harness." He studied Tran's face. "But you already know this."

Tran nodded, explaining what they'd found beneath the city - the garden, the corrupted Nexus Engine, the transformed Aeon Keeper. Veylan listened without interruption, though his eyes widened at the mention of Nefaretti.

"A corporeal Aeon Keeper," he murmured. "Such a thing hasn't been seen in millennia."

"He's containing the corruption," Tran said. "For now."

"Then perhaps our mission here is complete, at least for the moment," Veylan suggested. "The Guild's engineers have what they need to establish our presence. Stormhelm has granted us limited permissions. And the immediate threat beneath the city is... managed."

Tran felt the Star Needle's pulse calling to him through the water channels, stronger now without the corruption interfering. "You think we should return to Sundrift?"

"I think," Veylan said carefully, "that forces are in motion across Earth. The Mages Guild's establishment here is just the beginning." He glanced toward the window, where the Grand Spire rose against the morning sky. "And I think that there are other matters requiring our attention."

Caelum, who had remained silent during their exchange, stepped forward. "Onyx and I will accompany you back to Sundrift. The corruption may be contained for now, but Ironspire isn't the only place where ancient technologies are stirring."

Tran felt the weight of his responsibilities - to the Star Needle, to Sundrift, to Keen waiting somewhere in the Moon Kingdom. But for the first time since arriving in Ironspire, the path forward seemed clear.

"We leave at noon," he decided. "There's nothing more we can do here."

As they prepared to depart, Tran cast one last look toward the place where they'd descended into the garden. Somewhere beneath their feet, Nefaretti was confronting forces that had remained hidden for centuries. And somewhere above, beyond Earth's atmosphere, something was happening on the Moon that would soon call him away from Sundrift again.

For now, though, the water channels flowed clear and true, guiding him home.

The morning sun glinted off the Star Needle as Tran and Caelum crossed back into Sundrift territory. After the corrupted energy beneath Ironspire, the clean flow of the water channels felt like coming home. Tran's Crimson Blood responded to each pulse, the familiar rhythm a welcome contrast to the city's wrongness.

"Your binding grows stronger," Caelum observed, riding beside him. Onyx moved with careful precision, as if reading the currents of power beneath the earth. "The Star Needle recognizes its guardian."

Tran nodded, feeling the connection stretching between himself and the ancient structure. But as they approached the geometric water channels that radiated from the Needle, something else caught his attention – a ripple in the flow, subtle but unmistakable.

"Do you feel that?" he asked, slowing his pace.

Caelum's expression sharpened. "Something foreign. Not corruption, but..."

"Not natural either," Tran finished, his Crimson Blood responding to the disturbance.

They followed the anomaly to the water's edge, where the channels converged in perfect symmetry. There, standing motionless at the point where water met land, was a figure in deep blue robes that seemed to flow like the current itself. Though their back was turned, something about their stance suggested they had been waiting – perhaps for hours, perhaps for years.

Tran approached cautiously, hand instinctively moving to his weapon. "Who are you?"

The figure turned slowly, revealing a face that seemed ageless – neither young nor old, neither male nor female, but something in between. Their eyes reflected the water's surface with unnatural clarity, and when they smiled, it was with the familiarity of an old friend reuniting after a long journey.

"Hi, I'm Mika," they said, their voice carrying harmonics that made the water channels pulse in response.

Before Tran could respond, the figure simply... dissolved, their form becoming indistinguishable from the mist rising off the water's surface. Within seconds, no trace remained except for impossibly distinct footprints leading away across the damp shore – footprints that shouldn't have held their shape in the shifting sands.

"What was that?" Tran asked, the Crimson Blood in his veins surging with recognition of something ancient, something tied to powers he was only beginning to understand.

Caelum dismounted from Onyx, kneeling to examine the footprints. "Something old," he murmured. "Older than the Guild. Perhaps older than the Star Needle itself."

"They knew me," Tran said, certain of it though he couldn't explain why. "Or at least, they knew what I carry." He looked down at his palm, where the Crimson Blood pulsed in his veins.

Onyx nickered softly, intelligent eyes fixed on the trail of footprints. The horse took a single step forward, then looked back at Caelum with clear intent.

"We follow," Caelum agreed, remounting. "But carefully. There was power in that one – not like the Anunnaki, not like the Aeon Keepers. Something... different."

Tran nodded, already moving to follow the impossible trail. The water channels seemed to whisper warnings and encouragements in equal measure, as if even they were uncertain what lay ahead.

What had begun as a return journey was becoming something else entirely – a path into mysteries older than any they had faced before. And somewhere, through the mist that shouldn't exist on this clear morning, Mika was waiting
