Prelude: The Crimson Horizon
The trade road dwindled beneath his horse's hooves, well-worn stones giving way to packed earth as the lone rider crested the final hill. Below, Sundrift spread before him like an artist's rendering—modest thatched roofs arranged in a perfect circle around a central spire that caught the late afternoon sunlight. Unlike the imposing walls of Ironspire he'd left behind, this village seemed to welcome rather than defend.
Water channels cut through the settlement in geometric patterns too precise to be natural, each stream flowing with purpose toward the monolithic structure at the center. The Star Needle, as he would later learn it was called, rose from the valley floor like a silent sentinel, its surface shifting with bioluminescent patterns that seemed almost alive.
The rider adjusted his pack, a collection of herbs and artifacts gathered during months of wandering. This was the last unmarked region on his weathered map—Sundrift, nestled in the shadow of Ironspire's influence but somehow apart from it. Something about the village called to him, though he couldn't have explained why if asked.
As he guided his horse down the hill, he noticed farmers in the outlying fields glancing up from their work, offering cautious nods to the stranger. Their easy manner stood in stark contrast to the suspicious stares he'd grown accustomed to in his travels.
"Welcome, traveler," called a woman tending an herb garden near the village entrance. Her hands were stained green from her work, but her smile was genuine. "Not often we get visitors this late in the season."
"Just passing through," he replied, dismounting. "Is there somewhere I might purchase supplies?"
"Rowan's shop has most anything you'd need," she said, pointing toward the village center. "He's just past the main well, can't miss it. I'm Elyse, by the way. Elyse Varran."
"Thank you, Elyse," he said with a nod, not offering his own name in return. Names held power, and he'd grown cautious with his.
Leading his horse through Sundrift's main thoroughfare, he took in the simple beauty of the place. Children played near the water channels, their laughter carrying on the gentle breeze. An elderly man sat beneath a massive tree whose bark bore strange markings that matched the patterns of the water flows. The man—Garic Ironwood, though the rider wouldn't learn this until later—watched him pass with eyes that seemed to see more than they should.
Rowan's shop was exactly where Elyse had indicated, a sturdy building with a forge attached to its side. Inside, shelves lined the walls, laden with practical goods rather than luxuries.
"Haven't seen you before," said the blacksmith, setting aside the blade he'd been sharpening. Heat from the nearby forge had left his face perpetually flushed, but his eyes were sharp and assessing. "What brings you to Sundrift?"
"Supplies," the rider replied, indicating a selection of dried meats and hard bread. "And perhaps information about the roads beyond."
As Rowan gathered the requested items, the rider's attention drifted to a small bowl of water sitting beside the counter. Unlike the clear waters of the channels outside, this liquid seemed to hold a faint crimson tinge when caught in the right light.
"Water from the sacred pool," Rowan explained, noticing his interest. "Said to have special properties. The elders collect it from where the channels converge beneath the Star Needle."
"And what properties would those be?" the rider asked, suddenly curious.
Rowan shrugged. "Healing, some say. Others claim it reveals truths. Mostly superstition, if you ask me, but tradition is tradition." He pushed the supplies across the counter. "That'll be eight coppers."
The transaction complete, the rider stepped back into the street, his gaze now drawn irresistibly toward the Star Needle at the village center. The afternoon sun had begun its descent, casting long shadows across the perfectly arranged channels. Something about their pattern seemed to call to him, a whispered invitation he couldn't quite hear but somehow felt in his blood.
Almost without conscious decision, he found himself walking toward the monolith, his horse's reins loose in his hand. As he drew closer, the bioluminescent patterns on its surface seemed to pulse in a rhythm that matched his heartbeat. The water channels converged here, forming a perfect spiral around the Needle's base, where a small pool collected the flowing waters before redistributing them throughout the village.
No one guarded the Star Needle—no fence, no warning signs, no priests or sentinels. It stood open to any who approached, yet the rider noticed that villagers gave it a respectful berth as they went about their business. Children playing nearby wouldn't splash in the pool at its base, despite the temptation of cool water on a warm day.
Standing at the edge of the spiral pattern, the rider felt a strange sensation—a pull, a thirst, a recognition of something both foreign and familiar. The Star Needle's surface patterns quickened their pace as he approached, as if responding to his presence.
A young man passed by, nodding politely. The rider would later recognize him as Tran, the Crimson Blood carrier, but now he was just another villager, unaware of the destiny about to crash down upon them all.
Near the water's edge sat a young woman, her legs crossed in meditation. Her stillness contrasted with the constant motion of village life around her, as if she existed slightly apart from it all. Later, he would know her as Keen, would witness her extraordinary abilities, but now she was simply a curiosity—a point of stillness in the flow of life.
The water at the Needle's base seemed to call to him. He knelt beside the pool, his reflection wavering in its surface. Something shifted beneath the water—a shadow, a current, a presence. Without thinking, he reached out, his fingers breaking the surface.
The moment his skin touched the water, a sharp pain lanced through his palm—as if something had cut him from within. He pulled back, but not before a drop of his blood fell into the pool. For a heartbeat, nothing happened. Then the water where his blood had fallen darkened, the crimson tinge intensifying before spreading outward in geometric patterns that matched the channels.
The pain subsided quickly, leaving behind a strange warmth that spread up his arm and into his chest. The Star Needle's surface flared briefly, its patterns aligning perfectly with the spreading crimson in the water before returning to normal. Something had changed—in the water, in the Needle, in him.
A piece of wheat stem caught his eye, lying beside the pool. He picked it up, placing it between his lips out of habit as he rose to his feet. The strange sensation faded, leaving only a faint echo of what had happened. He examined his palm, finding it unmarked despite the pain he'd felt.
"Everything alright there, traveler?" asked a passing elder, eyeing him with subtle concern.
"Yes," he replied, though he wasn't entirely sure that was true. "Just admiring your village."
"The Star Needle's quite a sight," the elder agreed. "Been standing longer than any can remember."
The rider nodded, already backing away from the pool, from the Needle, from whatever had just happened. His original intention to simply pass through Sundrift remained, but now carried a strange urgency. Something told him he should leave, should put distance between himself and this place before...
Before what?
He didn't know, but the instinct was strong enough to heed. Mounting his horse, he made his way back toward the village entrance, nodding politely to those he passed. Elyse was still in her garden, collecting the last of her herbs before sunset.
"Heading out already?" she asked, straightening to watch him pass.
"Best to make some distance before nightfall," he replied, though part of him wanted to ask about the strange sensation still lingering in his blood.
"Safe travels then," she called after him. "The western road follows the ridge if you're looking to avoid Ironspire's patrols."
He raised a hand in acknowledgment, guiding his horse back onto the trail that would lead away from Sundrift. The wheat stem dangled lazily from his lips as his mount's hooves kicked up small clouds of dust. The late afternoon sun stretched his shadow long across the path, and for a moment, all was peaceful.
His blood moved quietly through his veins, still sleeping, still innocent of its own power.
But peace, like shadows, can shift in an instant.
The first warning came not as darkness, but as wind—hot and sharp, like breath from a forge...

The first warning comes not as darkness, but as wind—hot and sharp, like breath from a forge. It tears the wheat stem from his lips, carries it away into a sky that suddenly seems too vast, too empty. Then the mountains shift.

At first, it seems impossible—these ancient peaks that have stood sentinel since time immemorial now appear to waver, as if seen through rising heat. But no—they're moving. Shuddering. The ground beneath his horse's hooves trembles with deep, thunderous booms that echo through bone and earth alike.

The shadow comes next.

Not like clouds blocking the sun, but something else—something vast and absolute sweeping across the land. It moves with purpose, as if devouring the very light itself. His horse stamps nervously, tossing its head as the temperature plummets. In the Star Needle's reflection, the darkness seems to have weight, substance, hunger.

That's when he sees them—the first survivors.

They burst from Sundrift's direction, terror lending speed to their feet. "They're all dead!" The words tear from their throats between ragged breaths. "They're all dead!"

His horse rears as more villagers stream past, and that's when he catches his first glimpse of what pursues them - a reptilian warrior, twice the height of a man, its scales gleaming dully in the unnatural twilight. Its eyes lock onto him for just a moment, slitted pupils widening with predatory interest.

But something else catches his attention.

In the distance, near the edge of town, a curious scene unfolds. A young woman sits calmly in the chaos, cross-legged as if in meditation, while a man stands guard beside her, confusion evident in his stance. The sight makes no sense - until the first reptilian warrior falls, its head rolling past the man's feet with no visible cause.

His horse's reins cut into his palm as he grips them tighter, and that's when it happens - a sharp pain, a trickle of blood, and suddenly the world...shifts. His vision sharpens impossibly, time seeming to slow as his pulse thunders in his ears. Power courses through him, foreign yet familiar, like remembering something he never knew he'd forgotten.

The Star Needle pulses in his peripheral vision, its rhythm matching the surge in his veins. For a heartbeat, he sees the water channels glow with the same light that's beginning to race through his blood. Ancient patterns, perfect circles, a design that's older than memory.

He dismisses it as battle focus, as survival instinct.
He doesn't yet understand what has begun to awaken.
Doesn't know that this moment marks both a beginning and an end.

Sundrift awaits, burning in the shadow of giants.
And nothing will ever be the same.


The spectral sight haunts him—a reptilian warrior passing through the meditating woman like smoke, stumbling on nothing. The man beside her—Tran, he'll later learn—brings his weapon down in a crushing blow as the creature staggers. The woman—Keen—snaps awake, and without a word between them, they sprint toward the heart of Sundrift.

His enhanced vision tracks their movement through the chaos. They weave between burning buildings, past Rowan's Forge where the blacksmith desperately works to arm whoever he can. Through the smoke, he catches glimpses of them engaging more reptilians, moving with an uncanny synchronization that makes his blood buzz with recognition.

Then he hears the scream.

Near the Verdant Grove, where the water channels converge in perfect geometric patterns, Elyse Varran and young Isla Solis are cornered by a reptilian warrior. Tran and Keen arrive first—Tran charging in while Keen seems to fade partially from view. But two more reptilians emerge from the shadows behind them.

Without thinking, he spurs forward. That strange power still courses through him, making everything sharper, clearer. He sees Isla stumble, sees Elyse try to pull her to safety. His mount crashes into one of the reptilians, buying Tran and Keen precious seconds.

"Get them to the ridge!" Tran shouts, not questioning the timely intervention of a stranger.

Isla's ankle is twisted, bleeding. As he helps her up, his bloodied palm grips her arm—and something impossible happens. The wound begins to close, color returning to her face. He dismisses it as a trick of the light, as Elyse's healing herbs taking effect.

But Elyse's wide-eyed stare suggests otherwise.

"The Council Tree," she manages, pointing toward higher ground where ancient runes mirror the Star Needle's strange markings. "Garic was gathering survivors—"

Thunder rolls overhead—but there's no lightning, no rain. Just that endless shadow and the booming footsteps of giants in the distance. Garic Ironwood stands beneath the ancient branches, their bark etched with the same precise patterns as the water channels below. His usual cryptic manner is replaced by urgent command.

"Quickly now," he beckons. "Elyse—your herbs, we have wounded. Isla, child, stay close."

More villagers emerge from the smoke-filled streets. Garic meets your eyes, reading something there that makes him pause. The Star Needle's reflection shimmers in his weathered gaze, its pulse matching the throb of power in your veins.

But before he can speak, a reptilian warrior crashes through the underbrush, followed by two more. Your wounded palm throbs. The power in your veins surges.

The first reptilian lunges—not at you, but at Isla. Your arm raises instinctively, defensively. Then something impossible happens.

Blood arcs from your palm like a liquid whip, too fast to follow. It doesn't just strike the reptilian—it wraps around its throat, constricting. For a heartbeat, everyone freezes. The reptilian's eyes widen with recognition, as if it knows what you are. What this power is.

Then your blood retracts, absorbing back into your skin. The reptilian collapses, its throat crushed by a force that shouldn't exist. Above, the Star Needle pulses once, violently, as if responding to your power's awakening.

"By the old powers..." Garic whispers, but there's no time for questions.

"The ridge!" Elyse shouts, already guiding people toward the escape route. "Falcon Ridge! We can shelter in the caves!"

More reptilians approach. Your blood pulses, eager, hungry. This time it wasn't just adrenaline. This time you felt it—something awakening, something that was always there, waiting.

You don't understand yet that you weren't meant to survive this night.
You don't know that this power isn't a gift.
It's a countdown.
