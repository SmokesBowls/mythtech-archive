## Chapter 5: Arrival to Moonshade

The silver ships pierced ethereal clouds, hulls gleaming with Moon Kingdom radiance. Keen pressed her hand to the viewport, eyes wide as the patchwork below resolved into crystalline structures—buildings that defied Earth’s geometry, their spires like frozen light stretching skyward.

“We're coming in to land,” Rongtai announced, her voice taut with caution. “Moonshade Hollow—once the gateway to the Moon Queen’s palace.”

Thang’s golden eyes glinted under the moonlight. “What do you see?” he asked, his voice low.

Keen hesitated. “It’s like… remembering a place I’ve never been.” Her fingers traced unconscious patterns on the glass—echoes of the layout below. “These structures—impossible angles, wrong proportions... but they feel right.”

“The Moon Kingdom bends laws we know,” Thang murmured. “Physics, magic… even time. What’s broken there may be whole here.”

The ship landed on a platform of liquid silver solidified mid-ripple. Before them sprawled a city half-ruined, yet pulsing with strange vitality. Shadows danced where no figures moved; light curved instead of cornered.

“Come,” Rongtai said, unsealing the hatch. “The Hollow won’t stay clear for long.”

Keen stumbled into Moonshade Hollow. Her body felt heavier and lighter all at once. A strange vertigo tugged at her—a mirror of Sundrift, where she’d sat still in chaos, rooted yet apart.

“What is this?” she asked, bracing against a column.

Thang answered by tossing glittering sand into the air. The grains hovered—neither falling nor rising—coalescing into a miniature orbit of light.

“Try,” he said, extending his hand.

Keen hesitated. “I don’t know how—”

“You do,” Rongtai interjected, voice soft. “You did it in Sundrift. When you moved without moving. Your body remembers what your mind forgot.”

Keen shut her eyes, reached inward, outward. A presence stirred. She raised her hand—not physically, but willfully—and a single particle detached, brushing her fingertips like a star.

“That’s—” she began, but broke concentration, and it fled.

“The first lesson,” Thang said gently. “Intention without distraction. Don’t impose will—recognize the connection already there.”

“I don’t understand.”

“You will,” Rongtai said. “The Applicators hold the palace’s lower levels. Reaching the sanctum will teach you more than words ever could.”

---

Navigating Moonshade was a gauntlet of shifting physics. Keen floated, dragged, stumbled. Shadows moved with purpose—some even detached to devour skittering mechanical scouts in the periphery.

“Applicators,” Thang explained. “They report back to the hive.”

“Rongtai’s shadows,” Keen observed. “They’re… autonomous.”

“As are yours,” Thang said. “You just haven’t noticed yet.”

Keen turned—her shadow stood back at a junction, still, sentinel.

“I didn’t—”

“Watch,” Thang whispered.

They approached a courtyard where moonlight pooled like mercury. Three humanoid forms patrolled—glitching, half-mechanical, skin flaking to reveal wires.

“Possessed vessels,” Rongtai murmured. “If they see us…”

Keen studied the shadows, the light’s angles, the gravity shift…

She entered her meditative state—more intent this time. She reached into the space between, slipping through reality like silk between dimensions.

“Now walk,” Thang said.

Keen stepped—not physically, but through layers. She passed through one of the vessels. Cold brushed her soul. It didn’t react.

“How do we all cross?” she asked, voice distant to her own ears.

“We don’t,” Thang replied. “This is your path.”

“I don’t know where—”

“Yes, you do,” Rongtai interrupted. “The Moon Kingdom recognizes its Queen. Let it guide you.”

They vanished into shadow. Keen was alone. And yet, she wasn’t afraid. Something ancient stirred inside. She turned toward the sanctum—and walked.

At the Star Needle’s foundation, Tran felt power pulse beneath his palm. The glow in his veins—Crimson Blood—had dimmed but remained linked.

“Again,” Garic said. “But listen this time.”

Tran inhaled, syncing breath with the Needle’s thrum.

Ba-dum. Ba-dum.

Older than time. His blood resonated—not just with water, but with something primal.

“The channels aren’t for irrigation,” Tran murmured. “They’re power conduits.”

“Yes,” Garic confirmed. “But power unused is nothing.”

Tran opened his eyes. “Someone like me directs it.”

“The Crimson Blood is a key. But a key needs a hand to turn it.”

Frustration flared. “Why won’t you just tell me what this is?”

“Because knowledge without understanding is more dangerous than ignorance.”

A ripple stirred the channel—Tran reached instinctively. Water rose and froze mid-air.

“I didn’t mean—”

“You did what was needed,” Garic said. “The Needle didn’t give you power. It revealed it.”

Tran focused—splitting the arc into spheres. Crystallizing them. They caught sunlight—blood and gold.

“Magic?” he asked.

Garic laughed. “Call it what you like. Magic is connection—between blood and matter, thought and world.”

Tran let the spheres dissolve. “Keen’s power… it’s different.”

“She bridges realms—physical to ethereal. The Spirit Warrior.”

“She belongs in the Moon Kingdom.”

“No,” Garic corrected. “She leads. The Kingdom is broken. Its queen must rise.”

Tran turned to the Needle. “Then my place is here.”

“For now. But Crimson Blood and Spirit Warrior—separate, yet one. What’s divided must reunite.”

A stone. A ripple. Garic summoned water—not in arcs, but flowing, alive.

“You can do this?”

“Through time. Observation. Yours is blood. Mine is patience.”

Tran tried again—not forcing, but joining. The water danced.

“Yes,” Garic said. “Now you begin to understand.”

A horn blared—three blasts.

“Scouts. Lesson ends.”

He turned. “Remember—your power creates or destroys. That choice is yours.”

Tran stayed behind, watching the crimson light in his veins match the Needle’s pulse.

Elsewhere, Keen moved toward the sanctum. Viên walked a different path.

And yet, their destinies were converging.

---

Thang moved through corrupted chambers, leaving fading trails of golden light. The Applicators had spread—further than ever.

At a junction, walls darkened—black veins threaded like disease. Pools of once-liquid moonlight stagnated.

Thang pressed his hand to a wall—recoiled. The Applicators weren’t alone. Something older loomed behind them.

Clicking echoed. He cloaked himself in refracted light.

A possessed guard passed—jerky, soulless. But its armor bore Moon Kingdom insignia.

“They’ve corrupted our own,” Thang whispered.

He summoned a sphere of multicolored light. It embedded in the guard, phasing through.

The guard seized.

“H-help,” it rasped.

Then control snapped back.

“They’re imprisoned,” Thang breathed. “Still conscious. Still savable.”

He let the guard pass. Keen had to know: the true power of the Spirit Warrior was liberation—not destruction.

And she was walking into a trap.

He moved, urgency burning behind his eyes.

Viên stood at the edge of the Temporal Nexus. Around him, time split, flowed, rewrote itself.

The Temporal Guardian hovered, form flickering between past and present.

“You resist,” she said. “You grasp at linearity.”

“I’m trying to understand.”

“Then surrender. Become time.”

“Become—?”

She gestured. Scenes swirled—countless histories. “Choose. With intention.”

One image pulled him in—Tran at the Star Needle.

Viên reached. Time twisted.

He stood, unseen, watching Tran train. Echoes of feeling filled him—Crimson Blood and Adrenochrome harmonizing.

“We’re brothers,” he whispered. “Essence-deep.”

Yes, the Guardian’s voice echoed. Different paths. Same origin.

Time rewound. A living-stone lab. The Supreme Female Anunnaki cradled two vials—crimson fire, void-black.

“Two paths,” she whispered. “Order and chaos. Both required.”

Then—Tran, a child, taken from a cell. A dragon lay chained.

Then—Viên as an infant, held by the same Anunnaki.

“My mother,” he whispered.

“She shaped your blood. But why?” the Guardian asked. “That is your journey.”

Visions shifted—futures branching like rivers. One showed Keen, Viên, Tran—united.

“The convergence approaches,” the Guardian said.

“The Adrenochrome,” Viên asked. “How do I control it?”

“You don’t. You align. It responds to intention—clear, envisioned futures.”

He extended a hand. His blood surfaced, patterned with flowing time. He focused—a stream revealed Keen.

“I can see her…”

“Time and space,” the Guardian replied, “are fabric folds. Intention stitches them.”

He reached out—felt her presence flicker, then fade.

“Not yet,” the Guardian said. “You’re not ready to touch destiny. Only witness.”

“But I’m ready,” Viên said.

The Nexus agreed. Currents formed a path forward—not across space, but through time.

He stepped in. Not as a lost soul, but as a Guardian rising.
