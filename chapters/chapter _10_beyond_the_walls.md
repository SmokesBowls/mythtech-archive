Chapter 10 Beyond the Walls

The shimmering heat of midday distorted the distant horizon as Tran led the small party away from Ironspire's imposing silhouette. Caelum rode beside him, Onyx's hooves striking a steady rhythm against the dusty road. The intelligent horse's ears flicked occasionally toward the girl riding behind Caelum—Isla, who had stubbornly refused to stay behind.
"The footprints are fading," Tran observed, kneeling to examine the impossible tracks left by the Five Mikas. What had been distinct impressions in the dust now seemed more like faint suggestions, ghostly reminders that shimmered in and out of visibility depending on how the light struck them.
"They're not meant to last forever," Caelum replied, dismounting to study the tracks himself. "Just long enough to guide us to the first trial."
Isla slid from Onyx's back, her small frame landing with practiced ease. Despite her youth, there was an uncanny confidence in her movements, a sense that she knew exactly what she was doing even when surrounded by uncertainty.
"The old stories say the Mikas never reveal a full path," she said, adjusting her pack. "Only the next step."
Tran glanced at her, surprised. "What old stories?"
"The ones my mother told me before she died." Isla's expression remained carefully neutral, though something flickered behind her eyes. "Stories about the keepers of ancient magic and the tests they set for those worthy of their knowledge."
Caelum exchanged a look with Tran, both men realizing there was more to Maretha Solis's daughter than either had suspected. The Crimson Blood pulsed in Tran's veins, responding to the mention of ancient magic in ways he couldn't yet understand.
"The Star Needle's binding," Tran said, changing the subject as he placed a hand against his chest where the connection to Sundrift's monolith still thrummed. "It feels... different out here. Not weaker, exactly, but..."
"More diffuse," Caelum suggested. "Like a rope unraveling into threads."
"Yes." Tran nodded, surprised by the centaur warrior's intuition. "Does that mean the Mikas were right? That I can travel farther without breaking the binding?"
Onyx nickered softly, drawing their attention to the horizon. The barren landscape stretched before them, gradually transitioning from the fertile lands surrounding Ironspire to something harsher and more forbidding. In the distance, heat mirages shimmered above what appeared to be endless dunes.
"The Faraxar Wastes," Caelum said grimly. "Home of the Dregans."
Isla's eyes widened slightly at the name, though she quickly composed herself. "Elyse mentioned them. Said they remember the Anunnaki too well."
"With good reason," Caelum replied, mounting Onyx once more. "The Dregans were among the first experiments of the Anunnaki—powerful, intelligent, but ultimately deemed flawed. When the Anunnaki created humans instead, the Dregans were abandoned to die in the wastes."
"But they didn't die," Tran guessed.
"No." Caelum extended a hand to help Isla back onto Onyx. "They adapted. Survived. And they've never forgotten their creators' betrayal."
The implications hung heavy in the air. If the Dregans hated the Anunnaki, how would they react to Tran's Crimson Blood—an essence that resonated with ancient powers?
As they prepared to continue, a flash of blue light caught Tran's attention. A puddle had formed where no water should exist, and in its reflective surface, Blue Mika's face appeared briefly before dissolving into ripples.
"They're still watching," Tran murmured.
"Then let's give them something worth watching," Caelum replied, his hand resting on his weapon. "The wastes await."

The transition from fertile plains to desert wasteland happened with unsettling speed. One moment they were traveling through tall grasses, the next crossing hard-packed earth baked by relentless sun. By late afternoon, fine sand had begun to gather in drifts across their path, and the temperature had risen to nearly unbearable levels.
Isla, despite her stubborn insistence on joining them, showed no signs of complaining. She rode behind Caelum with quiet determination, occasionally pointing out unusual rock formations or the rare signs of life that managed to survive in this harsh environment.
"There," she said suddenly, indicating a twisted shrub clinging to life beside their path. "Desert sageroot. Elyse says it's rare and valuable."
Tran paused, studying the plant with newfound interest. "Valuable how?"
"It preserves water," Isla explained, sliding from Onyx's back and kneeling beside the shrub. With practiced movements, she cut several branches and stored them in her pack. "If we brew it into tea tonight, we'll need less water tomorrow."
Caelum nodded approvingly. "Your mother taught you well."
A shadow of grief passed across Isla's face, quickly suppressed. "She taught me lots of things. Things she said I'd need someday."
The words hung between them, laden with implications none of them fully understood. Tran helped Isla remount, his thoughts turning to his own adoptive parents. Had they known more than they revealed? Had they prepared him in subtle ways for the journey that now lay before him?
The Star Needle's pulse in his blood offered no answers, but it remained steady despite the growing distance from Sundrift. Perhaps the Mikas were right about the nature of his binding—it was a connection, not a chain. The thought was both liberating and terrifying.
As the sun began its descent toward the horizon, the landscape changed once more. Great stone formations rose from the sand like the bones of ancient beasts, creating a natural labyrinth that forced them to wind their way forward rather than proceeding in a straight line.
"We should find shelter for the night," Caelum suggested, eyeing the darkening sky. "The wastes are dangerous enough by day."
Tran nodded, scanning their surroundings. "There," he said, pointing to a formation of rocks that created a natural alcove. "That should provide some protection."
They made camp with efficient movements, Caelum building a small fire while Isla prepared the sageroot tea she had promised. Tran sat with his back against the cool stone, the crystal from Elara heavy in his pocket. He'd been avoiding it since they left Ironspire, uncertain whether he was ready to face whatever knowledge it contained.
As night fell completely, the desert transformed. The heat of day gave way to a bone-deep chill that made them huddle closer to the fire. Above them, stars blazed with an intensity rarely seen near civilization, their light casting faint shadows across the sand.
"It's time," Caelum said quietly, nodding toward Tran's pocket. "We're far enough from Ironspire now. The crystal's energy won't attract unwanted attention."
Isla looked up sharply, her eyes reflecting the firelight. "What crystal?"
Tran hesitated, then withdrew the memory crystal Elara had given him beneath Ironspire. Its surface caught the firelight, sending fractured rainbows dancing across their faces.
"A memory crystal," he explained. "Given to us by a member of the Mages Guild before we left. It supposedly contains information about the Dragon Mail."
"About your heritage," Caelum corrected. "The Dragon Mail is merely part of that story."
Isla leaned forward, fascination evident in her expression. "How does it work?"
"Blood," Tran replied, turning the crystal in his palm. "My blood, specifically."
Drawing his knife, Tran hesitated only briefly before making a small cut across his palm. The Crimson Blood welled up, glowing faintly in the darkness. When he pressed it against the crystal's surface, the effect was immediate.
The crystal flared with blinding light, rising from his palm to hover in the air before them. Its glow intensified, then expanded outward, forming translucent images that surrounded their small camp. A spectral voice—neither male nor female—filled the air.
"The Dragon Mail was forged in the death throes of the great serpent Tiamat, its scales infused with Vril energy by the Aeon Keepers. In the time before memory, when the Anunnaki still walked among their creations, it was worn by the guardians of balance—those chosen to stand between the powers that shaped this world."
The images shifted, showing a magnificent suit of armor that seemed alive, its scales rippling with inner light. It adorned a warrior whose face remained shrouded in shadow, but whose bearing spoke of great power and purpose.
"Only those of the Crimson Blood may bear the Dragon Mail, for they alone can withstand its hunger. The armor bonds with its wearer, becoming an extension of their will, amplifying their inherent power while imposing its own purpose."
Tran watched, transfixed, as the images showed the armored figure facing creatures of nightmare—beings of shadow and flame that towered above human scale.
"The last bearer fell during the Sundering, when the veil between worlds grew thin. The Dragon Mail was shattered, its pieces scattered across the lands beyond Ironspire. Five fragments, five guardians, five trials to prove the worth of the one who would reunite them."
The crystal's light dimmed slightly, the images becoming more focused. It showed a map—crude but recognizable—of the territories beyond Ironspire. Five points glowed upon it, each marked with a symbol that corresponded to one of the Mikas.
"The Blue Fragment lies beneath the waters where the cliff meets the sea. The Green Fragment rests in the heart of the ancient forest where the Nefretti dwell. The Red Fragment burns eternal in the volcanic fields of the north. The White Fragment dances among the clouds above the highest peak. And the Violet Fragment..."
The voice faltered, the image wavering. "The Violet Fragment was entrusted to the Keeper of Crossroads, where past and future meet. Seek it only when the others have been claimed, for it alone knows the true purpose of the Dragon Mail."
The crystal pulsed once more, then shattered into dust that scattered across the sand. The spectral voice lingered a moment longer:
"The transformation approaches. The Dragon Mail must be whole again before He returns."
Then silence fell, broken only by the crackling of their small fire. Tran stared at his palm where the crystal had been, his mind racing with implications. Caelum's expression was grave, while Isla seemed both frightened and exhilarated by what they had witnessed.
"Five fragments," Tran said finally. "Five trials."
"The Mikas weren't exaggerating about the challenges ahead," Caelum observed. "This journey will take us to the most dangerous territories beyond Ironspire."
"But the crystal didn't say anything about who 'He' is," Isla pointed out. "The one who's returning."
Tran's gaze lifted to the stars overhead, a strange certainty forming in his heart. "I think it's the one who flew into the Sun. Mr. GPT." The name tasted both familiar and foreign on his tongue, as if part of him had always known it while another part had just discovered it.
Caelum nodded slowly. "The legends say he sacrificed himself to prevent a catastrophe. But perhaps sacrifice isn't the same as death."
The fire popped and sparked, sending embers swirling into the night sky. Tran watched them rise, each tiny light a reflection of the Crimson Blood that flowed through his veins. The binding to the Star Needle hummed within him, a constant reminder of responsibilities left behind, while ahead lay the promise of discovered heritage and untapped power.
"We should rest," he said finally. "Tomorrow we follow the Mikas' path to the first fragment."
As they settled in for the night, Tran took the first watch, his gaze fixed on the distant horizon. Somewhere beyond those dunes lay answers to questions he'd never thought to ask—about his blood, his purpose, and the transformation reshaping their world.
In the darkness of the desert night, a faint red glow appeared briefly on a nearby dune—Red Mika, watching with evident interest before dissolving into the shadows. The first trial was approaching, and with it, the true beginning of Tran's journey beyond Ironspire's walls.

Dawn broke over the Faraxar Wastes in a blaze of orange and gold, the sun's fierce light revealing details of the landscape hidden by night. What had seemed like endless dunes now showed itself as a complex terrain of rocky outcroppings, hidden valleys, and occasional patches of stubborn vegetation.
Tran woke to find Isla already up, carefully rationing their water supply and preparing a breakfast of dried provisions from her pack. Her efficiency was impressive, especially for one so young.
"The desert will get worse before it gets better," she explained when she noticed his observation. "We need to conserve everything."
Caelum emerged from his meditative state—the centaur warrior's version of sleep—and surveyed their surroundings with a practiced eye. "She's right. We're approaching the heart of the Dregans' territory. Water becomes scarcer, while dangers multiply."
They ate quickly and broke camp, leaving no trace of their presence behind. The Mikas' footprints had reappeared overnight, now leading directly toward a narrow canyon that cut between towering sandstone formations.
"Convenient," Tran remarked, eyeing the canyon with suspicion.
"Too convenient," Caelum agreed. "It's the perfect place for an ambush."
"But it's also where we need to go," Isla pointed out, already securing her pack to Onyx's saddle. "The footprints lead there."
Tran studied the canyon entrance, his hand resting on his weapon. The Crimson Blood within him seemed to pulse with anticipation, as if eager for whatever challenge lay ahead. "We proceed carefully. Caelum, you and Onyx take point. I'll guard our rear. Isla, stay between us."
They entered the canyon in this formation, alert for any sign of movement among the rocks above. The temperature dropped noticeably as they moved deeper into shadow, the sun's direct heat blocked by the high walls on either side. Their footsteps echoed slightly, creating an unsettling chorus of sound that made it difficult to identify other noises.
"Look at the walls," Isla whispered after they'd traveled about a hundred paces into the canyon.
Tran glanced up and felt his breath catch. The canyon walls were covered in ancient carvings—depictions of winged humanoids locked in combat with golden figures that could only be Anunnaki. The scenes told a story of creation, betrayal, and exile, culminating in images of the winged beings establishing dominance over the desert wastes.
"Dregan history," Caelum murmured. "Written by the survivors."
As they pressed deeper into the canyon, the carvings became more elaborate and disturbing. They showed the Dregans capturing human travelers, conducting bizarre rituals with their captives, and eventually... transforming them. The final panels depicted hybrid creatures—part human, part Dregan—serving as warriors in what appeared to be an army gathering for war.
"They're planning something," Tran observed, his unease growing. "These carvings are recent—the stone hasn't weathered much."
"Not planning," came a harsh voice from above. "Executing."
They looked up to see figures perched along the canyon rim—tall, powerfully built humanoids with leathery wings folded against their backs. Their skin was a dusty gray-brown that blended perfectly with the surrounding rocks, and their eyes gleamed with predatory intelligence.
Dregans. At least a dozen of them.
"Weapons ready," Caelum said calmly, drawing his sword while Onyx shifted into a battle stance.
Tran positioned himself protectively in front of Isla, the Crimson Blood surging in response to the threat. His hand found the hilt of his blade, but he hesitated to draw it—violence might not be the only solution here.
"We're just passing through," he called up to the Dregans. "We mean no harm to you or your kind."
A harsh, grating sound echoed through the canyon—laughter, Tran realized with a chill. One of the Dregans spread its impressive wings and dropped to the canyon floor, landing with surprising grace despite its bulk. It stood at least seven feet tall, its muscular frame adorned with primitive armor crafted from bone and metal scraps. Around its neck hung a collection of small objects that Tran recognized with horror as human finger bones.
"Passing through?" The Dregan's voice was like gravel scraping against stone. "No one passes through Dregan territory without paying a toll."
"What sort of toll?" Tran asked, though he suspected he already knew the answer.
The Dregan's mouth split in a terrible grin, revealing rows of sharp, yellowed teeth. "The small one," it said, pointing a clawed finger at Isla. "She will make a fine addition to our ranks."
"No." Tran's response was immediate and firm, the Crimson Blood now burning hot beneath his skin. "She's under our protection."
The Dregan's eyes narrowed, then widened suddenly as it took a closer look at Tran. Something like recognition flashed across its bestial features.
"You..." it hissed, taking an involuntary step backward. "You carry the Blood of Masters."
A murmur ran through the Dregans watching from above, their wings rustling nervously. Tran didn't correct the creature's misunderstanding—if they believed his Crimson Blood connected him to the Anunnaki, perhaps it would give them pause.
"I do," he said, allowing a hint of the power within him to manifest as a faint crimson glow around his hands. "And I ask again—let us pass in peace."
The lead Dregan snarled, clearly torn between fear and anger. "The masters abandoned us to die in these wastes. Why should we show mercy to their kin?"
"Because I'm not them," Tran replied. "I seek knowledge of my heritage, nothing more. We have no quarrel with the Dregans."
Another Dregan dropped to the canyon floor, this one older, its wings tattered at the edges and its face crossed with jagged scars. It wore elaborate decorations of bone and metal, marking it as a leader of some kind.
"The Blood alone is not enough," this elder Dregan announced, its voice deeper and more resonant than the first. "If you claim to be different from the masters, prove it. Face the trial of the sands."
Caelum tensed beside Tran. "The trial of the sands is a death sentence," he warned quietly. "Few survive it."
"What is this trial?" Tran asked the elder Dregan.
"Simple." The creature's scarred face twisted into what might have been a smile. "Cross the Heart of Faraxar—alone and unarmed. If you survive, we will know your words are true. If you fall..." It shrugged its massive shoulders. "Then your companions will serve our needs instead."
Isla moved closer to Tran, her expression fearful but determined. "Don't do it," she whispered. "There has to be another way."
But Tran knew there wasn't. The canyon was too narrow for effective combat, and the Dregans held every advantage here. More importantly, this felt right—like the first of the trials the Mikas had promised.
"I accept," he told the elder Dregan. "But I want your word that my companions will be safe while I'm gone."
The elder Dregan placed a clawed hand over its chest in a formal gesture. "By the bones of our ancestors, we swear it. They will not be harmed unless you fail."
"Tran, this is madness," Caelum protested. "The Heart of Faraxar is said to be alive—a section of desert that hungers for flesh and blood."
"Then it should appreciate mine," Tran replied with grim humor. He turned to Isla, his expression softening. "Stay with Caelum and Onyx. They'll protect you if... if I don't return."
Isla's eyes shimmered with unshed tears, but she nodded bravely. "You'll return," she said with surprising certainty. "My mother always said the Crimson Blood finds a way."
The casual mention of his blood's nature from one so young struck Tran again. How much had Maretha Solis known? How much had she passed on to her daughter before her death?
There was no time to question Isla further. The Dregans were growing impatient, their wings rustling and claws scraping against stone. Tran removed his weapons and pack, handing them to Caelum.
"Three days," the elder Dregan announced. "If you have not returned by the third sunset, we will consider you fallen."
"I'll be back before then," Tran said with more confidence than he felt.
The Dregans led him deeper into the canyon, eventually emerging into a vast basin surrounded by towering cliffs. In the center of this basin, the sand seemed different—darker, almost fluid in its movement despite the absence of wind.
"The Heart of Faraxar," the elder Dregan announced with theatrical flair. "Cross it, and you earn our respect. Fail, and it will consume you as it has consumed countless others."
Tran studied the expanse before him—perhaps a mile across at its widest point. The sand at the edges appeared normal enough, but toward the center, it rippled and shifted in patterns that suggested something alive lurked beneath the surface.
"Any advice?" he asked the elder Dregan, only half-joking.
The creature's scarred face split in a terrible grin. "Don't stop moving. Don't fall. And if you hear it singing... cover your ears."
With those cryptic words, the Dregans took flight, rising to perch along the rim of the basin where they would have excellent views of his ordeal. Tran took a deep breath, feeling the Crimson Blood pulse steadily within him. Without his weapons, without companions, he had only this ancient power to rely on.
"Let's see what you can really do," he murmured to his blood.
Then, with determination in every step, he began his journey across the Heart of Faraxar—the first true test on his path to claiming his heritage and understanding the transformation that waited beyond.
