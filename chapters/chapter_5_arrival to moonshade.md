Chapter 5: Arrival to Moonshade

The silver ships descended through wisps of ethereal cloud, their hulls glimmering in the peculiar light of the Moon Kingdom. Keen pressed her palm against the viewport, watching as the landscape below transformed from distant patchwork to distinct structures—buildings that defied earthly architecture, their crystalline spires reaching up as if to greet the arriving vessels.

"We're coming in to land," Rongtai announced, her voice steady despite the tension evident in her posture. "Moonshade Hollow. Once the gateway to the Moon Queen's palace."

Thang's golden eyes caught the moonlight as he studied Keen's reaction. "What do you see?" he asked quietly.

Keen hesitated, struggling to find words for the strange familiarity washing over her. "It's like... like remembering a place I've never been." Her fingers traced patterns on the glass, unconsciously mirroring the layout of the structures below. "Those buildings—they shouldn't be standing. The angles are all wrong, and yet..."

"And yet they feel right," Thang finished, a knowing smile crossing his bronze features. "The Moon Kingdom follows different laws than Earth. Physical, magical... even temporal. What seems impossible there is simply the natural order here."

The ship shuddered as it touched down on a platform of what appeared to be liquid silver frozen in mid-ripple. Beyond stretched a city half in ruins, yet somehow more alive than any earthly metropolis Keen had ever seen or imagined. Shadows danced where no movement should cause them; light bent around corners in gentle curves rather than harsh angles.

"Come," Rongtai said, unsealing the ship's hatch. "The Hollow won't stay clear for long."

---

Keen stumbled as they crossed the threshold into Moonshade Hollow, her body suddenly feeling both lighter and heavier simultaneously. The sensation reminded her of the moment in Sundrift—sitting cross-legged as chaos erupted around her, feeling both anchored and somehow... elsewhere.

"What is this?" she gasped, steadying herself against a nearby column.

Instead of answering directly, Thang reached into a pouch at his waist and withdrew a handful of what looked like glittering sand. "Watch," he said, releasing it into the air.

The particles hung suspended, neither falling nor floating upward, simply existing in a constellation of tiny stars around his outstretched hand. Then, with a subtle gesture, he caused them to orbit his palm in a complex pattern.

"Try," he said simply, extending his hand toward Keen.

She stared at the dancing particles, hesitation written across her features. "I don't know how—"

"You do," Rongtai interrupted, her tone surprisingly gentle. "The same way you knew how to sit still in the middle of battle. The same way you stepped aside from the reptilian's attack without moving your physical form. Your body remembers what your mind has forgotten."

Keen closed her eyes, focusing on that sensation—the feeling of being both present and separate. When she opened them again, she extended her hand toward the particles, not reaching physically but somehow... extending herself in a way that defied explanation.

The particles responded, trembling at first, then slowly, uncertainly bending toward her influence. One broke from the pattern, drifting to her fingertips where it clung like a tiny star.

"That's—" she began, but the moment her concentration broke, the particle shot away, rejoining the others in their orbit around Thang's hand.

"The first lesson," Thang said, smiling. "Intention without distraction. The Moon Kingdom responds to focused will. It's not about forcing your desire onto reality—it's about recognizing that your will and reality are already connected."

"I don't understand," Keen admitted, frustration edging her voice.

"You will," Rongtai said. "But not through explanation. Through experience." She gestured toward the ruined palace that loomed in the distance. "The applicators have taken the lower levels. We must reach the sanctum above. Every step of that journey will teach you more than words ever could."

---

The journey through Moonshade's broken streets was an education unlike any Keen had imagined. Each step required constant adaptation—sometimes she felt almost weightless, other times gravity seemed to pull from unexpected directions. Shadows moved with purpose, occasionally sliding away from their casters to intercept the strange, mechanical insects that skittered in the periphery of their vision.

"Applicators," Thang explained, as Keen watched a shadow engulf one of the creatures. "Small scouts. They report back to their collective."

"Rongtai's shadows," Keen observed. "They move independently."

"As do yours," Thang replied. "Though you haven't recognized it yet."

Keen frowned, looking back at her own shadow—only to realize it had remained several paces behind, standing guard at a junction they'd already passed.

"I didn't—" she began, but Thang raised a hand to silence her as they approached a courtyard where moonlight pooled like liquid silver.

Across the open space, three figures moved with unnatural synchronization—humanoid in shape but jerking like marionettes controlled by unskilled hands. Their forms seemed to glitch, occasionally revealing mechanical components beneath what looked like human skin.

"Applicator vessels," Rongtai whispered. "Possessed. We can't cross without them detecting us."

Keen studied the courtyard, something tugging at her awareness. The pools of moonlight, the shadows cast by broken columns, the strange gravity that seemed centered differently here...

Without fully understanding why, she closed her eyes and sank into that meditative state that had first manifested in Sundrift. This time, however, instead of simply letting her consciousness expand, she pushed it outward with purpose, feeling for the boundaries of her own existence.

She felt rather than saw Thang's approving nod. "Yes," he murmured. "Find the space between."

When Keen opened her eyes again, the world had changed. The courtyard still existed, but now she could see layers of reality stacked like transparent sheets—the physical world, the shadow realm, and something else... a space between where things were neither fully material nor completely ethereal.

"Now walk," Thang instructed.

Keen took a step forward, but not in the way she normally would. Instead of moving her physical body, she shifted her perception into that in-between space, bringing just enough of her physical form along to maintain her presence in the world. She glided across the courtyard, passing directly through one of the possessed figures—feeling a momentary chill as its corrupted energy brushed against her consciousness but causing no disturbance in its patrol pattern.

From the other side, she turned back to see Thang and Rongtai watching her—Thang with pride, Rongtai with something that might have been respect.

"How do we all cross?" she called back, her voice sounding distant even to her own ears.

"We don't," Thang answered. "Not together. This is your path to walk alone for now. We'll find another way around and meet you at the sanctum steps."

Keen felt a surge of panic. "But I don't know where—"

"Yes, you do," Rongtai cut in. "The Moon Kingdom recognizes its Queen. Let it guide you."

Before Keen could protest further, they melted back into the shadows, leaving her alone in the courtyard—balanced between states of being, surrounded by enemies, in a realm she barely understood.

And yet... somewhere deep inside, something was awakening. A knowledge older than her conscious mind, a connection to this place that transcended her brief time within it.

She turned toward the distant sanctum and took another step into her destiny.

---

Tran stood at the edge of the Star Needle's foundation, feeling the subtle pulse of power that flowed through the ancient structure. The crimson light that had suffused his veins after the merging had dimmed to a barely perceptible glow, but the connection remained—a constant awareness of the water channels that spread through the valley like veins, carrying the Needle's influence to every corner of the realm.

"Again," Garic instructed, his weathered face giving away nothing of his thoughts. "But this time, don't force it. Listen first."

Tran exhaled slowly, placing his palm against the Needle's surface. Unlike before, he didn't push his awareness outward. Instead, he quieted his mind, allowing the Needle's rhythmic pulse to fill his consciousness.

Ba-dum. Ba-dum. Ba-dum.

Like a heartbeat, but not his own. Something older, vaster—a pulse that had continued uninterrupted for millennia. As he synchronized his breathing with that ancient rhythm, he began to sense the patterns of energy flowing through the channels. Not just water, but something else... something that responded to his blood in ways he couldn't yet understand.

"The channels aren't just for irrigation," he murmured, his eyes still closed. "They're... pathways. For power."

"Yes," Garic confirmed. "The Star Needle is a conduit—one of many spread across the world. But without someone to direct it, that power simply flows, untapped and undirected."

Tran's eyes snapped open. "Someone like me."

Garic's expression remained neutral. "The Crimson Blood has always been the key. But a key without a hand to turn it is merely a piece of metal."

Frustration welled in Tran's chest. "You speak in riddles, old man. If you know what this power is, what I'm supposed to do with it—"

"If I simply told you, you would have knowledge without understanding," Garic interrupted. "And that is far more dangerous than ignorance."

Before Tran could respond, a ripple passed through the nearest water channel—subtle, but to his newly sensitized awareness, it might as well have been a tidal wave. He turned toward it, instinctively reaching out with his mind.

The water responded, rising in a perfect arc before freezing in mid-air.

"I didn't mean to—" Tran began, but Garic shook his head.

"You did precisely what was needed. The Needle didn't create this power in you; it merely awakened what was always there." The old man gestured to the suspended water. "Now, what will you do with it?"

Tran studied the frozen arc, feeling his connection to every droplet. With careful focus, he separated the arc into dozens of individual spheres, each perfectly formed and hovering in the air before him.

"The Crimson Blood allows for precision," Garic observed. "Control. The ability to divide and direct energy with intention."

Tran concentrated harder, imagining the spheres hardening, crystallizing. To his amazement, they responded—transforming from liquid to something that resembled glass, catching the sunlight in prisms of crimson and gold.

"Is this... magic?" Tran asked, the word feeling strange on his tongue after a lifetime of being taught to fear and avoid it.

Garic's laugh was short and dry. "A simplified term for a complex reality. What you call 'magic' is merely the understanding of connections that have always existed—between blood and water, between thought and matter, between the Star Needle and the forces that flow through all things."

Tran released his concentration, allowing the crystallized spheres to dissolve back into the channel. "Keen... she had a different power. Not like this."

"The Spirit Warrior's gift," Garic nodded. "While your power connects to the physical—water, earth, the tangible forces of creation—hers bridges the gap between realms. Between the physical and the ethereal."

"And that's why they took her to the Moon Kingdom," Tran realized. "Because she belongs there somehow."

"Not belongs," Garic corrected. "Leads. The Moon Kingdom has been without its rightful ruler for too long. The balance has shifted, and with it, the protective barriers between realms."

Tran turned back to the Star Needle, watching as crimson light pulsed faintly along its length in response to his emotions. "And my place is here. To protect this."

"For now," Garic agreed. "But your paths will cross again. The Crimson Blood and the Spirit Warrior are two sides of the same coin—separate but inseparable. What has been divided must eventually be reunited."

Tran pressed his palm more firmly against the Needle's surface, feeling the power surge in response. "Then I need to master this. Quickly."

"Mastery comes not from rushing but from understanding," Garic cautioned. "Watch."

The old man picked up a small stone and tossed it into the water channel. Ripples spread outward, and to Tran's surprise, the water rose in response—not in a controlled arc as he had managed, but in a complex, flowing pattern that morphed from one shape to another with organic grace.

"You can do this too?" Tran asked, startled.

Garic smiled enigmatically. "There are many paths to understanding the world's connections. Yours is through blood. Mine... is through time and observation."

He gestured for Tran to try again. "Now, don't think about controlling the water. Think about joining with it. Your blood and the water are not separate things to be forced together—they are already connected. You are simply... remembering that connection."

Tran closed his eyes once more, focusing not on making the water obey, but on feeling its natural movement, its inherent patterns. This time, when he reached out with his mind, the response was immediate and fluid—the water rising not in rigid shapes but in flowing forms that seemed to dance with his thoughts.

"Yes," Garic murmured. "Now you begin to understand."

In the distance, a horn sounded—three short blasts that echoed through the valley. Garic's expression darkened.

"The scouts have spotted something. Our lesson must end for now." The old man turned to leave, then paused. "Remember, Tran—the power you wield can create or destroy. The choice of which path to walk is yours alone."

As Garic's footsteps faded, Tran remained by the Needle, watching the crimson light pulse through his veins in time with the ancient structure's rhythm. Creation or destruction. Protection or domination. The weight of that choice settled on his shoulders like a physical burden.

Somewhere far above, Keen was facing her own challenges, discovering her own power. And somewhere beyond his understanding, Viên was walking yet another path.

Three different journeys, three different powers—and yet, Tran couldn't shake the feeling that they were all connected to something vaster than any of them had yet comprehended.

The world was awakening. And they were awakening with it.

---

Thang moved through the lower chambers of the sanctuary, his footsteps leaving brief trails of golden light that faded seconds after contact. The applicator infestation was worse than he'd anticipated—not just in the lower city but penetrating deeper into the Moon Kingdom's heart than ever before.

Something had changed. The balance had shifted.

He paused at a junction where the crystalline walls had begun to darken, veins of black corruption spreading like disease through once-pure structures. Nearby, a pool that had once flowed with liquid moonlight now sat stagnant, its surface occasionally rippling as something moved beneath.

Placing his palm against the corrupted wall, he closed his eyes, extending his awareness into the structure itself. The applicators' influence was unmistakable—mechanical and parasitic, breaking down the natural resonance of the Moon Kingdom's architecture and replacing it with their own rigid patterns.

But behind that, something else lurked. Something older and far more dangerous.

Thang withdrew his hand as if burned, golden eyes widening with realization.

"The applicators aren't working alone," he murmured to the empty corridor. "They're preparing the way for something else. For..."

He couldn't bring himself to finish the thought. If he was right, then Keen's training couldn't wait. What had once been a journey of discovery had become a desperate race against time.

A soft sound drew his attention—a rhythmic clicking approaching from a side passage. Thang pressed himself against the wall, summoning a veil of light that bent around his form, rendering him momentarily invisible to conventional sight.

The source of the sound soon emerged—a human figure moving with the jerky precision of applicator possession, its eyes hollow points of light in an otherwise expressionless face. But unlike the vessels they'd seen in the courtyard, this one wore the unmistakable insignia of the Moon Kingdom's royal guard on its tattered uniform.

Thang's heart sank. The applicators weren't just creating new vessels; they were corrupting those already connected to the Kingdom's power. Which meant...

"The sanctuary is compromised," he whispered as the possessed guard passed without noticing him. "And Keen is walking right into it."

He had to reach her before she entered the inner chambers unprepared. But first, he needed to understand exactly what they were facing.

With careful precision, Thang summoned a small sphere of concentrated light to his palm. Unlike his usual golden energy, this light pulsed with a rainbow of colors, cycling through the spectrum with increasing speed.

"Show me," he commanded softly.

The light shot forward, embedding itself in the possessed guard's back. Instead of damaging the vessel, the sphere seemed to phase through its physical form, attaching to something within.

The guard jerked to a halt, its body convulsing as Thang's light fought against the applicator control. For a moment, the hollow eyes flickered, showing glimpses of awareness beneath the possession.

"H-help," a voice rasped, so different from the mechanical tones of applicator vessels that Thang nearly dropped his concentration in shock. "They're in the—"

The guard's body seized, cutting off the words as the applicator reasserted control. But that brief moment of consciousness told Thang what he needed to know. The original beings weren't being erased by possession—they were being imprisoned within their own bodies, fully aware but unable to act.

Which meant they could potentially be saved.

The guard resumed its patrol, the momentary break in the applicator's control apparently unnoticed by whatever hive mind directed these vessels. Thang remained still until it had turned the corner, then released the breath he'd been holding.

Keen needed to know what they were truly facing. Not just for her training, but for the monumental task that lay ahead—reclaiming the Moon Kingdom not by destroying its possessed inhabitants, but by finding a way to free them.

The true power of the Spirit Warrior wasn't destruction at all, but liberation.

Thang smiled grimly. If anyone was capable of such a miracle, it would be the new Moon Queen—provided she survived long enough to claim her throne.

With renewed urgency, he slipped down the corridor, golden light trailing in his wake as he raced to find Keen before it was too late.

---

Viên stood at the precipice between moments, watching as time flowed around him like a river splitting around a stone. The Guardian of the Temporal Nexus hovered nearby, her form shifting between states of past, present, and future with each pulse of the void that surrounded them.

"You're resisting," she observed, her voice echoing strangely as if coming from multiple points in time simultaneously. "Holding onto linear perception."

Viên clenched his fists, feeling the power in his blood responding to the temporal energies that surrounded them. Unlike the Gateway or the Star Needle's channels, the Nexus didn't respond to his blood with harmonious resonance or even chaotic interference—it simply absorbed it, as if his Adrenochrome was merely one of countless energies flowing through its eternal currents.

"I'm trying to understand," he countered. "There's a difference."

The Guardian's form solidified briefly, her expression impossible to read. "Understanding is not achieved through intellectual grasping, but through surrender. You cannot comprehend time by standing apart from it. You must become it."

"Become time?" Viên's voice held an edge of frustration. "What does that even mean?"

Instead of answering directly, the Guardian gestured to the swirling temporal currents around them. Within the flow, images formed and dissolved—moments from history playing out like reflections in disturbed water.

"Choose," she instructed. "Any moment. But choose with intention."

Viên studied the flickering scenes, thousands of years of history bleeding together in a chaotic tapestry. How could he possibly select a single moment from this infinite expanse? What criteria should guide such an impossible choice?

Then, among the countless possibilities, a familiar face appeared—Tran, standing before the Star Needle, his veins glowing with Crimson Blood as water rose in flowing patterns around him.

Without conscious thought, Viên reached toward the image, his blood surging in response. The moment he made contact, the Nexus shifted—reality twisting as the current of time caught him like a riptide, pulling him not just toward the scene but somehow into it.

Suddenly, he was there—standing at the edge of consciousness, witnessing Tran's training through a strange, shimmering veil that separated him from physical reality. He could see everything, hear everything, but remained undetectable to the participants.

"I'm... observing?" he asked, though the Guardian was nowhere to be seen.

More than observing, her voice answered directly in his mind. You're experiencing. The difference is crucial.

As she spoke, Viên realized he could feel echoes of Tran's emotions—determination, frustration, wonder at the power flowing through him. More than that, he could sense the Crimson Blood's relationship to his own Adrenochrome—like two instruments playing different parts of the same melody, separated yet inherently connected.

"We're brothers," he whispered, the realization landing with unexpected weight. "Not just in circumstance but in essence."

Yes. Your blood and his came from the same source, though shaped by different influences. What flows through you both is the legacy of choices made millennia ago.

The scene shifted without warning, time spinning backward to reveal a laboratory carved from living stone. Within it, a woman with otherworldly beauty stood before a series of crystalline containers, each holding something that pulsed with vibrant energy.

"The Supreme Female Anunnaki," Viên breathed, somehow knowing her identity without being told.

She turned, almost as if hearing him across the gulf of time, her eyes filled with an intelligence that transcended human comprehension. In her hands, she held two vials—one burning with crimson fire, the other swirling with shadows that seemed to consume light itself.

"Two paths," she spoke to someone outside Viên's field of view. "One of order, one of chaos. Both necessary for what is to come."

The vision dissolved, replaced by another—Tran as a child, being carried from a prison cell by a figure obscured in shadow. Behind them, something massive lay slumped in chains, scales gleaming dully in the dim light.

"Tran's dragon father," Viên realized. "And that's... Geralt? Taking him away?"

Before he could process this revelation, the scene changed again—this time showing himself as an infant, cradled in the arms of the same Supreme Female Anunnaki, who gazed down at him with an expression that might have been affection or merely scientific interest.

"My mother," he whispered, the word feeling strange on his tongue. "She created us both. But why? For what purpose?"

The Guardian reappeared beside him, her form more substantial within the flow of temporal observation. "That is the question at the heart of your journey. Not just what you are, but why you were created—and what choice you will make now that you understand your origin."

Viên watched as the vision of his infant self faded, replaced by countless possible futures branching outward like the tributaries of a vast river—some bright with promise, others dark with implications too terrible to contemplate.

"The Adrenochrome in your veins is not just power," the Guardian continued. "It is potential in its rawest form. The ability to exist between order and chaos, to bridge the gap between what is and what could be. While the Crimson Blood anchors and stabilizes, your gift is to disrupt and transform."

"And Keen?" Viên asked. "Where does she fit in this pattern?"

The Guardian's expression softened slightly. "The Spirit Warrior stands between worlds—between the physical and ethereal, between moon and earth, between ancient power and new possibility. She is the bridge that neither you nor Tran can be alone."

The Nexus shifted again, the flow of time stabilizing around them as they returned to the void between moments. Viên felt different—not just in his understanding, but in his awareness of his own blood. The Adrenochrome no longer seemed like an alien force flowing through him, but an integral part of his being.

"The past is not just history to be learned," the Guardian said, gesturing to the currents that continued to flow around them. "It is a living force that shapes the present and defines the possible futures. As a Temporal Guardian, you must learn to navigate not just through time, but with it—understanding how each moment connects to all others."

"And my blood?" Viên asked, watching as the Adrenochrome pulsed beneath his skin, now synchronized with the temporal currents around him. "How do I control it?"

"You don't," the Guardian replied simply. "Any more than you control your heartbeat or the flow of your thoughts. Instead, you align with it, guide it, channel it toward purpose. The Adrenochrome responds not to commands but to intention—to the futures you can envision clearly enough to manifest."

Viên extended his hand, watching as his blood rose to the surface of his skin, forming intricate patterns that mirrored the temporal flows around them. With careful focus, he directed his intention toward a specific current—one showing Keen making her way through the ruins of Moonshade Hollow.

To his amazement, the current responded, expanding to fill his vision as his consciousness aligned with that moment in time.

"I can... see her," he said, watching as Keen navigated the dangers of the Moon Kingdom. "Right now, across the void of space."

"Time and space are arbitrary divisions of the same fabric," the Guardian explained. "Distance means nothing to one who understands the true nature of temporal connection."

Viên focused harder, trying to reach out to Keen—to send some warning, some message across the gulf that separated them. For a moment, he felt her awareness brush against his, her consciousness registering his presence as a fleeting impression before the connection broke.

"Not yet," the Guardian cautioned. "Such direct intervention requires greater mastery than you currently possess. For now, observe and understand. Your paths will converge when the time is right."

The vision of Keen faded, leaving Viên once again floating in the void of the Nexus. But now, instead of chaotic, overwhelming currents, he could distinguish patterns within the flow—possibilities and probabilities, fixed points and fluid moments, all interconnected in a vast tapestry that stretched beyond comprehension.

"What now?" he asked, feeling both humbled and empowered by the vastness of what he had glimpsed.

"Now," the Guardian replied, "you begin to walk the path of a Temporal Guardian in earnest. Not just observing time, but learning to guide its flow—to heal fractures, strengthen connections, and eventually, to shape what comes next."

She gestured, and a new current formed before them—showing not past or present, but one of countless possible futures. Within it, Viên saw himself standing with Tran and Keen, the three of them forming a triangle of power around something hidden from view.

"The convergence approaches," the Guardian said softly. "When Crimson Blood, Spirit Warrior, and Adrenochrome unite with clear purpose. What emerges from that moment will echo across all of time."

The vision dissolved, leaving Viên with more questions than answers. But one thing had become clear—his journey was far more than a quest to find Keen or understand his own powers. It was about forging connections across time itself, preparing for a moment of decision that would reshape everything.

He looked down at his hands, watching the Adrenochrome pulse with newfound purpose. No longer chaotic or frightening, but a tool of infinite possibility—if he could learn to wield it wisely.

"I'm ready," he told the Guardian, and for the first time since his powers had manifested, he believed it.

The Temporal Nexus responded to his resolve, currents shifting to create a path forward—not just through space, but through time. Where it led, he couldn't yet comprehend. But he understood now that his blood, his heritage, his very existence had been shaped for this journey.

With one final look at the infinite possibilities surrounding him, Viên stepped into the current, allowing time itself to carry him toward destiny.
