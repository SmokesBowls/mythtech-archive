# MythTech Forge: Awakening the Archive

> *"When the Archive was broken, the stars turned black. Now the glyphs glow again—and so the cycle begins."*

---

## Purpose

Welcome, Seeker of the Vril, to the MythTech Forge—an encoded archive where lost magic and fractured technology merge. You stand within the digital shell of an ethereal library, scripted by the Aeon Keepers, haunted by the Applicators, and rewritten by you.

This project documents and constructs the foundation of the **MythTech Codex**, a modular narrative built through dialogue, spell systems, NPC lore, conspiracies, and fractured memories. Magic here is not a resource—it’s a reckoning.

---

## Archive Structure

- `chapter_dialogue/` — All modular conversation sequences.
- `chapter_npc/` — Characters, faction bios, statblocks, behavioral logic.
- `chapter_magic/` — The MythTech Codex: spell entries, Vril-tech, rune systems.
- `chapter_subtitles/` — Modular story segments like scene titles, subchapter headers.
- `conspiracy_lore/` — Redacted truths, ancient technologies, decoded glyph scrolls.

Each directory is a living vault. Update it. Feed it. Respect it.

## Next Steps in the Forge

- Create `spellbook_intro.md` as a master index of spells by class, faction, and lore node.
- Track variant wielders of each spell (e.g., Viên’s shadow-tuned Whiphold).
- Integrate Vril resonance mechanics into item systems.
- Connect dialogue triggers to spell unlocks via subtitle flags.

## Ritual Notes

- Use consistent filename format: `subchapter_XX_title.md` or `dialogue_XX.json`
- Maintain modularity. Nothing is sacred except structure.
